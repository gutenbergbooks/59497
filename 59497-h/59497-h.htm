<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

</div>

<p>In this sketch, called by Korolenko “a
psychological study,” the author has attempted
to analyze the inner life of the
blind. He has undertaken to lay before
the reader not only the psychological
processes in the mind of the blind,
but their suffering from the lack of sight
as well, uncomplicated by any untoward
circumstances.</p>

<p>To accomplish this he has placed his
hero in most favorable, nay, almost exceptional
conditions. The subjects for this
study are a blind girl, whom the author
had known as a child; a boy, a pupil of
his, who was gradually losing his sight;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
and a professional musician, blind from
his birth, intellectually gifted, scholarly,
and refined.</p>

<p>Upon the completion of my translation, I
submitted it to Mr. M. Anagnos, of the Perkins
Institution for the blind, and received
from him the following note, which he has
kindly permitted me to make public:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Madam</span>,—I have read, with due
care and deep interest, your translation of
Vladimir Korolenko’s book, entitled “The Blind
Musician,” and I take great pleasure in being
able to say that the story, although very simple
both in form and substance, is conceived and
elaborated with a masterly skill. It is ingenious
in construction, artistic in execution, and full of
imaginative vigor. The author shows a keen
appreciation of what is charming and beautiful
in Nature and a fine power of analysis. His
ideas on the intellectual development and physical
training of the blind are correct, and cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
but deepen the interest of the reader in the
various phases of the story. That some of his
psychological observations, derived from the
study of a limited number of cases, represent
individual characteristics or idiosyncrasies which
cannot be applied to all persons bereft of the
visual sense, in no wise detracts from the value
of the work....</p>

<p class="center">Sincerely yours,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">M. Anagnos</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>May this simple story, written from
the heart, reach the heart of him who
reads it!</p>

<p>It affords me great pleasure to link my
name with that of Vladimir Korolenko
by writing a few words in the form of
an introduction to the translation of that
gifted young author’s “Blind Musician,”
which is now to appear for the first time
in English.</p>

<p>I knew Korolenko by reputation and
by his work long before I made his personal
acquaintance. While engaged in
making an investigation of the exile system
in Siberia, I met many of his banished
friends and comrades; and my attention
was first called by them to the series of
graphic sketches of Siberian life and experience
that he was then publishing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
“Russian Thought,” “The Northern Messenger,”
the “Annals of the Fatherland,”
and other Russian periodicals. I read
them carefully, and formed from them at
once a high opinion of the author’s character
and talent.</p>

<p>Upon my return from Siberia in the
summer of 1886, I stopped for a few
days in the old Tartar town of Nizhni
Novgorod on the Volga (where Mr.
Korolenko was then living), for the express
purpose of calling upon a writer
whose life and whose work had so deeply
interested me. I need not describe the
impression that he made upon me further
than to say, that a feeling of warm
personal regard and esteem for the man
was soon added to the admiration that I
already had for him as a literary artist.
Mr. Korolenko seems to me to represent
the most liberal, the most progressive, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
the most sincerely patriotic type of young
Russian manhood. The influence that he
has exerted, personally and by his writings,
has always been on the side of liberty,
humanity, and justice; and there
could hardly be a more significant commentary
upon the existing form of government
in Russia than the fact that this
talented author, before he was thirty-five
years of age, had been four times banished
from his home to remote parts of
the empire, without even the form of a
judicial trial, and had twice been sent as
a political exile to Siberia. If he had
been an active revolutionist like Lopatin,
or even a writer upon prohibited social
and political subjects like Chernishèfski,
his banishment to Siberia would have
been more comprehensible; but he was
neither one nor the other. He was removed
to the province of Vòlogda, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
afterward to the province of Viatka, merely
because the police regarded him as a “neblagonadëzhni”
(politically untrustworthy
person), and then he was exiled to Siberia
as a result of a stupid police blunder.
When, after years of hardship and privation,
he finally returned to his home, he
was called upon to take the oath of allegiance
to Alexander III., and to swear
that he would betray every one of his
friends or acquaintances whom he knew
to be engaged in revolutionary or anti-Government
work. No conscientious and
self-respecting man could take such an
oath, and Mr. Korolenko, of course, declined
to do it. He was thereupon exiled
by administrative process to the East-Siberian
province of Yakutsk, where in
a wretched Yakut “ooloos” he lived for
three years, and where he made some of
the character studies, such as “The Vagrant”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
and “Makàr’s Dream,” that first
attracted to him the attention of the Russian
reading public.</p>

<p>Mr. Korolenko has not thus far published
anything like a long and carefully
worked out novel of Russian life; but the
fault is not his own. He wrote such a
novel under the title “Pròkhor and the
Students” in 1886 or 1887, and the first
chapters of it were printed in the well-known
magazine “Russian Thought” in
1888. As soon however as the plot began
to develop and the nature and tendency
of the story became apparent, the
censor interposed with his veto; and the
publishers of the magazine were compelled
to announce to its readers that
“on account of circumstances beyond
their control” the remainder of the novel
could not be printed.</p>

<p>Mr. Korolenko’s short stories, sketches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
and studies of character show so much
talent, originality, and artistic skill that
if he were untrammelled, and could work
out his ideas and conceptions in his own
way, there would be every reason to predict
for him a useful and brilliant literary
career. Unfortunately, however, all Russian
authors are forced to work within the
bounds set for them by an arbitrary and
often stupid censorship; and the most
promising career may be utterly ruined
by the caprice of an ignorant official, or
by a sentence of exile for life or for a
long term of years to the sub-arctic province
of Yakutsk. I can recall the names
of a dozen young Russian authors, journalists,
or poets, among them Korolenko,
Màchtet, Lessèvitch, Volkhòfski,
Petropàvlovski, Chudnòfski, Klemens,
Ivanchìn-Pìsaref, and Staniukòvitch, who
are in Siberia now, or have spent there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
some of the best years of their young
manhood.</p>

<p>One can only wonder at and admire the
courage, the energy, and the persistence
of men like Korolenko, who, although
gagged by the censor, imprisoned, and
banished to the remotest parts of Siberia,
work on with heroic patience, and finally
make their names known and respected,
not only in their native country but
throughout the civilized world.</p>

</div>

<p>At the hour of midnight, in
a wealthy family living in the southwestern part
of Russia, a child was born. As the first faint,
pitiful cry of the baby echoed through the
room, the young mother, who had been lying
with closed eyes, unconscious to all appearances,
stirred uneasily in the bed. She murmured
a word or two in a low whispering tone,
while her pallid face, with its sweet and almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
childlike features, was disfigured by an expression
of impatience,—like that of a spoiled
child, who resents the unwonted suffering as
something new to her experience. The nurse
bent low to catch the inarticulate sounds that
fell from her whispering lips.</p>

<p>“Why, why does he—?” murmured the
invalid in the same impatient whisper.</p>

<p>The nurse did not understand the question.
Again the child cried out, and again the same
shadow of sharp pain darkened the face of the
mother, while large tears rolled down from her
closed eyes.</p>

<p>“Why, why,” she repeated in a whisper.</p>

<p>At last the meaning of her question seemed
to occur to the nurse, who answered quite
calmly,—</p>

<p>“Oh, you mean why does the child cry?
Babies always do. You must not agitate yourself.”</p>

<p>But the mother was not to be pacified. She
started every time the little one cried, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
kept repeating in tones of angry impatience,
“Why—why—so dreadfully?”</p>

<p>To the nurse there seemed nothing unusual
in the cries of the infant; and supposing the
mother to be either unconscious or simply
delirious, she left her, and busied herself with
the child.</p>

<p>The young mother said no more, but from
time to time an anguish too deep for expression
brought the tears to her eyes. They
forced their way through the thick black eye-lashes,
and slowly rolled down her pale marble-like
cheeks. Perchance her mother’s heart
was torn by a presentiment of some dark, abiding
misery hanging like a heavy cloud over the
infant’s crib, and destined to accompany him
through life even unto the grave. These signs
of emotion, on the other hand, were very likely
nothing more than the wanderings of delirium.
But however this may have been, the child
was indeed born blind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>At first no one perceived it. The boy had
that vague way of looking at objects common to
all very young infants. As the days went by,
the life of the new-born man could soon be
reckoned by weeks. His eyes grew clearer;
the thin film that had overspread them disappeared,
and the pupil became defined. But the
child was never seen to turn his head, to follow
the bright sunbeams that found their way into
the room; nor did the merry chirping of the
birds, nor the rustling of the branches of the
green beech-trees in the shaded garden beneath
the windows, attract his notice.</p>

<p>The mother, who had now recovered, was
the first one to mark with anxiety the strange
immobility of the child’s expression, so invariably
calm and serious. With pitiful eyes, like a
frightened dove, she would question those about
her: “Tell me what makes him look so unnatural?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>“What do you mean?” strangers would
reply in tones of indifference; “he looks like
all other children of his age.”</p>

<p>“But watch him! See how oddly he fumbles
with his hands!”</p>

<p>“The child cannot yet regulate the movements
of his hands by the impressions which his
eyes receive,” replied the doctor.</p>

<p>“Why does he look constantly in one direction?
He is—blind!”</p>

<p>As the dread suspicion found utterance in
words, not one of them could calm the mother’s
agitation. The doctor took the child in his
arms, and turning him suddenly toward the
light, looked into his eyes. An expression of
alarm passed over his countenance, and after a
few vague remarks he took his leave, promising
to return in two days. The mother moaned
and fluttered like a wounded bird, pressing the
child to her bosom, while the boy’s eyes kept
ever the same steadfast and rigid stare.</p>

<p>The doctor did return in two days, bringing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
with him an ophthalmoscope. After lighting a
candle, he proceeded to test the eyes of the
infant by flashing it suddenly before them and
as suddenly withdrawing it; finally, with an expression
of distress, he said,—</p>

<p>“It grieves me deeply, Madam, but I am
forced to admit that you have divined the truth.
The boy indeed is blind,—irremediably blind.”</p>

<p>Sadly, but without agitation, the mother listened
to this announcement. “I knew it long
ago,” she softly murmured.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>The family into which this blind child was
born was a small one. Its other two members
were the father and “Uncle Maxim,” so called
not only by his own people, but also by friends
and acquaintances. The father was a fair example
of the landowners in the southwestern
district. He was good-natured, even kindly,
probably an excellent overseer of the workmen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
fond of building and making alterations in his
mills. These occupations consumed all his
time; hence his voice was seldom heard in the
house except at the regular hours for dinner,
lunch, or other events of a similar character.
At such times he never failed to ask his customary
question of his wife, “Are you feeling well,
my dove?” After which he would seat himself
at the table, and make no further remarks save
perhaps an occasional observation on the subject
of cylinders or pinions. It might be expected
that his quiet and simple existence would
find a pale reflection in the nature of his son.</p>

<p>Uncle Maxim was of quite a different temperament.
Ten years previous to the events we
are about to describe, he had been famed for
his quarrelsome temper, not only in the vicinity
of his own estate, but even in Kiev and at the
Contracts.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> No one could understand the existence
of such a brother in a family so respectable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
as that of Pani<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Popèlska, née Yatzènko. Amicable
relations with such a man were out of the
question, for it was impossible to please him.
He insolently repelled the advances of the Pans,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
and overlooked an amount of wilfulness and impertinence
on the part of the peasants, which
would have been punished with blows by even
the mildest among the nobility. Finally, to the
great joy of all respectable persons, Uncle Maxim
for reasons best known to himself became very
much displeased with the Austrians, and departed
for Italy. There he joined Garibaldi, a heathen
soldier, who like himself delighted in fighting,—and
who, as it was rumored among the Pan-landlords,
was in league with the devil, and
showed no reverence for the Pope. By such
actions Maxim of course imperilled forever his
restless, heretical soul; but on the occasion of
the Contracts fewer scandals took place, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
many an excellent mother felt more at ease concerning
the welfare of her sons.</p>

<p>The Austrians, on their part, were doubtless
angry with Uncle Maxim. Now and then his
name appeared in the “Courier,”—a favorite
old paper of the Pan-landlords,—united with
those of Garibaldi’s most daring comrades;
and one day the Pans read in the same “Courier”
that Uncle Maxim had fallen with his horse
on the battle-field. The enraged Austrians, who
had long been waiting for a chance to attack
this desperate Volynian,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> who in the opinion of
his countrymen was Garibaldi’s mainstay and
support, chopped him in pieces like cabbage.
“Maxim’s was a sad end,” said the Pans, and
ascribed it to the immediate interposition of
Saint Peter in behalf of his representative on
earth. Maxim was reckoned among the dead.
Subsequently, however, it became known that the
Austrian sabres had no power to expel Maxim’s
obstinate spirit, and that it still dwelt in his considerably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
damaged body. The Garibaldians,
rescuing their worthy comrade from the fray,
had carried him to some hospital, and, lo! after
a few years Maxim unexpectedly appeared in his
sister’s house, where he ever after remained.</p>

<p>But Maxim could fight no more duels. He
had lost his right foot, and was obliged to use a
crutch, while his left leg was so injured as to require
him to use also a cane. On the whole he
had lost much of his former excitability, and it
was only occasionally that his sharp tongue did
duty for his sword. He ceased to visit the Contracts,
seldom appeared in society, and spent
most of his time in the library reading; but in
regard to the contents of the books, save for the
<i lang="la">a priori</i> supposition that they must be atheistic,
no one had the faintest idea. He also wrote
from time to time; but as his compositions never
appeared in the “Courier,” they were supposed
to be quite insignificant.</p>

<p>About the time when the little new being
entered upon its career in the country house, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
might have noticed streaks of silver gray in
Uncle Maxim’s closely cropped hair. From
the constant use of crutch and cane he had grown
high shouldered, which gave to his figure a certain
square effect. His peculiar aspect, his
knitted brows, the clatter of his crutch and cane,
and the clouds of tobacco smoke in which he
was constantly enveloped, since he never took
the pipe from his mouth,—all these things intimidated
strangers, and only those who lived
with him knew that his crippled body held a
warm and kind heart, and that his large square
head covered with thick bristling hair was the
seat of constant mental activity.</p>

<p>But those who were nearer to him had but a
vague notion of the problems that perplexed and
absorbed Uncle Maxim’s mind at this time.
They only knew that he would sit motionless for
hours at a time, enveloped in a cloud of blue
smoke, with knitted eye-brows and a far-away
look in his eyes. Meanwhile this crippled
warrior was pondering upon the battle of life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and feeling that there was no room in it for invalids.
He pictured himself as having left the
ranks forever, and he felt like a man encumbering
the hospital ambulance. He was like a
knight, unseated and overthrown in the conflict
of life. Did it not show a lack of courage to
crawl in the dust like a crushed worm? Would
it not be a coward’s part to grasp the stirrup of
the conqueror, and beg for the sorry remnant
of his own life?</p>

<p>While Uncle Maxim was calmly considering
this vital question with all its <i lang="la">pros</i> and <i lang="la">cons</i>, a
new being appeared before his eyes, whose fate
it was to enter life an invalid from his very birth.
At first Maxim paid but little heed to the blind
child, but as time went on, the singular likeness
between the boy’s fate and his own interested
him. “Hm! Hm!” he thoughtfully muttered
to himself as he looked at the child from the
corner of his eyes, “this chap is also an invalid.
If we two could be put together, one useful man
might be made of us.” And after that he gazed
at the child more and more frequently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>The child was born blind. Who was to blame
for this misfortune? No one. There was no
slightest shade of the “evil eye;” the very cause
of the misfortune itself was hidden somewhere
in the depths of the mysterious and complex processes
of life. Anguish pierced the mother’s heart
as she gazed on her blind boy. She suffered not
alone as a mother, in her sympathy with her son’s
affliction, together with a sad prescience of the
painful future awaiting her child; but added to
these feelings there dwelt within the depths of
the young mother’s heart a consciousness that the
cause of this misfortune may have been latent,
as a dreaded possibility, in those who gave him
life. This in itself sufficed to make the little
creature, with his beautiful sightless eyes, the
central figure of the family and its unconscious
despot. Every member of the household strove
to gratify his lightest fancy.</p>

<p>What would in time have become of this boy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
unconsciously predisposed as he was to resent
his misfortune, and whose egotism was fostered by
all those who surrounded him, had not a strange
fatality combined with the Austrian sabres to
compel Uncle Maxim to settle down in the
country in his sister’s family,—no one can tell.
By the presence of the blind boy in the house,
the active mind of the crippled soldier was
gradually and imperceptibly directed into a new
channel. He would still smoke his pipe hour
after hour, but the old expression of pain and
dejection had given place to one of interest.
Yet the more Uncle Maxim pondered, the more
he wrinkled his thick brows, and more and more
heavy grew the volumes of smoke. Finally one
day he made up his mind to interfere.</p>

<p>“That youngster,” he said, puffing out ring
after ring of smoke, “will be much more unhappy
than I am. Far better had he never been
born.”</p>

<p>An expression of acute suffering saddened the
mother’s face as she gave her brother a reproachful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
glance. “It is cruel to remind me
of this, Max,” she said gently, “and to do it
wantonly!”</p>

<p>“I am simply telling you the truth,” replied
Maxim. “I have lost a hand and a foot, but I
have eyes. This youngster has no eyes, and in
time will have neither hands nor feet nor will.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Pray understand me, Anna,” said Maxim in
a gentler tone, “I would not reiterate these cruel
truths had I no object. This boy’s nervous
organization is extremely sensitive; hence it is
possible so to develop his other faculties that
their acuteness will compensate him, at least to
a certain degree, for his blindness. But to attain
this he must use his faculties; and the use
of one’s faculties must be compelled by necessity.
An unwise solicitude, that prevents him
from making any effort, will ruin his chances for
living a full life.”</p>

<p>The mother was sensible, and therefore knew
how to control that instinctive impulse which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
urged her, at every pitiful cry of the child, to
rush to him.</p>

<p>A few months after this conversation the boy
could creep about the rooms with ease and
rapidity; he listened intently to every sound,
and by his sense of touch eagerly examined
every object that happened to come within his
reach. He soon learned to know his mother by
her footstep, by the rustling of her dress, and by
certain other signs perceptible to him alone; it
made no difference to him whether there were
many persons in the room or not, or if they
changed their positions,—he never failed to
turn with unerring accuracy toward the spot
where she sat. When she lifted him in her
arms he knew at once that he was sitting in his
mother’s lap. When others took him up, he
would pass his little hands rapidly over the face
of the person, thus recognizing almost at once
the nurse, Uncle Maxim, or his father. But if it
happened to be a stranger, then the movements
of the tiny hands were more deliberate; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
boy passed them carefully and attentively over
the unfamiliar face, his features betraying his
intense interest. He seemed to be looking at
the strange face with his finger-tips.</p>

<p>By nature the blind boy was a very lively and
active child; but as month succeeded month,
blindness set its impress on the boy’s temperament,
which began to manifest its true character.
He gradually lost his rapidity of motion. He
would sit perfectly still for hours in some remote
corner, with unchanging expression, as if listening.
When at times the various sounds that
usually distracted his attention ceased, and the
room became quiet, the child would sit absorbed
in thought, and upon his beautiful face, serious
beyond his years, an expression of bewilderment
and surprise would appear.</p>

<p>Uncle Maxim was right. The exquisite organization
of the child manifested itself in an
extraordinary susceptibility of the senses of hearing
and touch, by means of which he verified
to a certain extent the correctness of his impressions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
All who saw him were amazed at
the wonderful delicacy of his touch. Occasionally
it even seemed as if he were able to
distinguish colors; for when, as sometimes happened,
bits of bright-colored cloth fell into his
hands, his slender fingers would linger over
them, while a look half of perplexity, half of
interest, would flash across his face. As time
went on, however, it grew more and more evident
that his susceptibility was principally developed
in the sense of hearing. He quickly
learned to distinguish the different rooms in the
house by sound; he recognized the steps of
the members of the household, the creaking of
his invalid uncle’s chair, the dry and measured
whiz of the thread in his mother’s hands, or
the regular ticking of the clock. Sometimes,
as he felt his way along the side of the room,
he would hear a slight rustle inaudible to others,
and put out his hand to catch a fly crawling
on the wall. When the startled insect rose and
flew away, an expression of painful surprise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
would come over the face of the blind boy.
He could not account for the mysterious disappearance
of the fly. But the next moment, in
spite of his perplexity, his face assumed an
expression of intelligent interest; he turned his
head in the direction taken by the fly,—his
acute sense of hearing having caught in the air
the scarcely perceptible sound of the insect’s
wings.</p>

<p>Of all the glittering, murmuring, bustling
world without, the blind child could form no
conception save by its sounds. That peculiar
expression characteristic of an intense concentration
of the sense of hearing had become
habitual to his face: the lower jaw was a little
depressed, the brows contracted, and the head
inclined slightly forward on its slender neck.
But the beautiful eyes, with their unchanging
gaze, imparted to the face of the blind child a
stern and at the same time a touching aspect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>The second winter of the boy’s life was drawing
to a close. The snow outside had begun to
thaw, and the streamlets to sing their spring
songs. At the same time the boy’s health
changed for the better. He had been rather
delicate during the winter, and had in consequence
been kept in the house, and never
permitted to breathe the outdoor air. The
double windows were now removed, and spring
with all the vigor of new life burst into the
rooms. The cheerful sun shone in at the
glittering windows; the leafless branches of
the beech-trees swayed to and fro; the distant
fields were black, save for the white patches of
melting snow still lying here and there, and the
spots where the young grass had begun to look
green. On every side the stimulating influence
of the spring imparted new vigor and life.
One seemed to breathe more freely.</p>

<p>To the blind boy within the room spring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
manifested its presence only by the swiftness of
its sounds. He could hear the rushing of the
floods running a race, as it were, leaping over
the stones, and sinking deep into the moistened
soil; the faint resonance of the whispering birch-trees
as their tossing branches beat against the
windows, and the rapid dripping of the icicles
that hung from the roof, which since the sun
had set them free from the chill embrace of the
night frost were hurrying away, their ringing
footsteps followed by a thousand echoes. All
these sounds made their way into the room like
a storm of pebble-stones beating a hurried tattoo
upon the ground. Above all these harmonies
of Nature could be heard from time to
time the calls of the storks echoing softly from
the distant heights, and dying gradually away as
if melting in air.</p>

<p>This new birth of Nature was reflected upon
the boy’s face in the form of distress and perplexity.
He would knit his brows, listen for a
while, then suddenly, as though alarmed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
mysterious hurrying of the sounds, he would
stretch forth his arms, seeking his mother, and
rushing to her would nestle in her bosom.</p>

<p>“What can be the matter with him?” the
mother cried, questioning herself and others.</p>

<p>Uncle Maxim carefully scanning the boy’s
face, could in no way explain his strange alarm.</p>

<p>“I suppose he cannot understand,” suggested
the mother, thus construing the expression of
mute surprise and distressed inquiry upon her
son’s face.</p>

<p>The child indeed was frightened and uneasy.
At first he had seemed to catch eagerly at the
unaccustomed sounds, but soon he showed his
surprise that the noises already familiar to his
ear were all at once hushed and gone.</p>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>Soon the chaotic sounds of spring-time died
away. Encouraged by the burning rays of the
sun, Nature fell into her ancient grooves, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
gradually settled down to work. The newly
springing life did its utmost; its rate of speed
increased like a swiftly rushing steam-train.
The tender grass was springing in the fields,
and the odor of the birch-buds filled the air.</p>

<p>It was proposed to take the boy out into the
meadows to the bank of the nearest river. The
mother led him by the hand, Uncle Maxim,
leaning on his crutch and cane, walked by her
side, and thus the three started for the little hill
near the river, where the sun and the wind had
already dried the ground. It was thickly carpeted
with green grass, and its summit commanded
quite a broad view. The brilliant
daylight dazzled the eyes of Maxim and the
mother; and when the sunbeams burned their
faces, the spring breeze came with its invisible
wings, dispelling the warmth by a refreshing
coolness. There was a sense of enchantment,
of intoxication, in the air.</p>

<p>The mother felt the child’s tiny hand clinging
fast to her own, but so transported was she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
by the exhilarating influence of the spring-time
that she was less keenly observant than usual of
this sign of childish alarm. She breathed in
long and full respirations, and walked along
without once turning her head. Had she
looked down at her boy, she would have discovered
a strange expression on his face. He
turned his wide-open eyes toward the sun with
a sense of surprise. His lips were parted; inhaling
the air, he gasped like a fish that has just
been taken out of the water; an expression of
mingled pain and delight was depicted on his
bewildered face, which passing over it like a
nerve-wave illumined the face for a moment,
yielding directly however to the former expression
of surprise, that might almost be called
alarm. The eyes alone constantly preserved
their steady, unchanging, and sightless gaze.</p>

<p>Having reached the hill, all three seated
themselves. As the mother was lifting the boy
to place him in a more comfortable position, he
caught nervously at her dress like one who is on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the point of falling, almost as if he no longer felt
the ground beneath his feet. Again the mother
took no heed of his alarm, because both her
own eyes and attention were absorbed in the
charming spring landscape.</p>

<p>It was noonday. Slowly the sun sailed across
the blue sky. From the elevation where they
sat could be seen the wide-spreading river. Its
ice had already floated down the current, save
a few occasional fragments dotting the surface
here and there, which were fast melting away.
On the low meadows the water was still standing
in broad lagoons, which reflected the blue
dome of the heavens and the snowy clouds that
slowly passed and vanished like the melting ice.
A gentle breeze rippled the glistening surface of
the river. Looking across to the opposite shore
one could see the dark grain-fields, whose steaming
vapor rising wave after wave veiled the
thatched huts far away in the distance, and obscured
the vague blue outline of the forest. It
was as if the earth sent up its clouds of incense
to the sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>All this, however, was visible only to those who
had eyes. The boy saw nothing of this picture;
he could not look upon that festival of Nature,
nor on her marvellous temple; his sensations
were vague and broken; his childish heart was
troubled. When he had first started, with the
sun’s rays falling full upon his face, warming his
delicate skin, he instinctively turned his sightless
eyes in its direction, as if he realized the central
force in the invisible picture before him. The
transparent distance, the blue dome overhead,
the wide horizon, had no existence so far as he
was concerned. The sole effect produced on
him was a sense of some material substance,
warming his face with its soft caress. Then
something both cool and light, although less
tangible than the warmth of the sun, lifted from
his face this sensation of tender caressing languor,
and left behind a delicious coolness.
Within the house the boy had become accustomed
to move freely, conscious of the space
surrounding him. Here he was encompassed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
by pursuing waves, which now caressed and now
excited and intoxicated him. The sun’s warm
touch was suddenly brushed away; a gust of
wind began to ring in his ears and to blow about
his face and temples,—indeed all over his
head, down to the very nape of his neck, whirling
around him as though it were trying to bear
him away, or to entice him somewhere into the
invisible space, benumbing his consciousness,
and lulling him into a languor of forgetfulness.
Then the boy’s hand would cling more closely
to his mother’s, and it seemed to him as though
his heart must cease to beat. However, after
he was seated he appeared to grow calmer. Already,
notwithstanding the strange sensation that
pervaded his whole being, he had begun to distinguish
the separate sounds. The atmospheric
waves were still dashing tumultuously about him;
and as the throbbings of his quickened pulse
beat time to the music of these waves, it seemed
to him that they were entering his very body.
From time to time they brought to him the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
lark’s sharp trill, the soft whisper of the budding
birch, or the gentle splash of the flowing river.
The lark, whizzing by on its light wings, paused
just overhead to describe its capricious circles;
the gnats buzzed; and over all, sad and prolonged,
rose the occasional cry of the ploughman,
urging his horses over a half-ploughed
strip of land.</p>

<p>The boy failed to grasp these sounds in their
entirety; he could neither unite them nor group
them in any satisfactory sequence. One by one
they seemed to project themselves into his dark
little head, now soft and vague; now loud, sharp,
and deafening. At times they came crowding
confusedly on each other, jumbled in meaningless
discord. Faster and faster ran the waves;
now it seemed to the boy as if above all this tumult
of sounds he could hear muffled echoes,
like memories of the past, coming to him from
another world. When the sounds grew fainter, a
sense of dreamy languor came over him; a convulsive
twitching betrayed the successive waves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
of feeling that swept across his face; he closed
his eyes, then opened them, and every feature
seemed to ask a question, striving to grasp the
situation. His childish sense of appreciation,
as yet but feeble,—overwhelmed as it was with
new impressions, although it still struggled
against the tide, making an effort to hold its
own, to combine them into something like unity,
and thus to gain the victory over them,—showed
signs of giving away. The task was too
great for the brain of a blind child, destitute of
the necessary images by means of which he
might have achieved it.</p>

<p>All these sounds rose into the air, flying to
and fro, and falling one by one, all too varied,
too resonant. The waves that had taken possession
of the boy rose with greater force from the
darkness that encompassed him with its reverberating
echoes, and were again resolved into
the same darkness, only to be replaced by other
waves and other sounds more and more hurried,
soaring above him, filling his soul with anguish;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
again they seemed to lift him up, as if lulling
him to repose with gentle rocking motion. Suddenly
above this vague confusion arose the long-drawn
note of a human call; then all at once
everything became still. With a faint moan the
boy rolled over backward on the grass. The
mother turned instantly, and she in her turn
uttered a cry: he was lying on the grass in a
deep swoon.</p>

<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>Uncle Maxim was very much disturbed by
this occurrence. He had of late ordered a
number of physiological, psychological, and educational
works, and with his habitual energy had
devoted himself to the study of all that science
has revealed concerning the mysterious growth
and development of a child’s soul. The delight
of these studies had so charmed him
that all brooding fancies concerning his own
uselessness in the battle of life, “the worm grovelling
in the dust,” and “the hospital ambulance,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
had long since vanished from the invalid’s
square head, and in their stead appeared
a deep and thoughtful absorption; rose-colored
hopes even came from time to time to warm
the veteran’s heart. Uncle Maxim grew more
and more convinced that Nature, although she
had deprived the boy of his sight, had not in
other respects dealt unjustly with him. He was
a creature who responded with remarkable
activity and completeness to the exterior impressions
accessible to him. Uncle Maxim
conceived it to be his duty to develop the latent
capabilities of the boy, so that the injustice
of his doom might be counterbalanced by
the efforts of his own mind and influence, and
that he might be enabled to send as a substitute
into the battle of life another and a younger
combatant, who without his influence would be
lost to the service.</p>

<p>“Who knows,” thought the old Garibaldian,
“but there may be a fight in which neither
lance nor sword are needed? Perchance he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
with whom fate has dealt so hardly may sometime
employ the weapons that he is capable of
wielding in the defence of others, victims of fate
like himself; and then my life will not have
been spent in vain, old crippled soldier that
I am!”</p>

<p>Even the free-thinkers during the forties and
fifties of the present century were not free from
superstitious ideas regarding the “mysterious
designs of Nature.” Therefore it was not surprising
that with the gradual development of the
child, who showed unusual gifts, Uncle Maxim
should have arrived at the firm conviction that
his very blindness was only one of the manifestations
of those mysterious designs. “One unfortunate
for another,”—this was the motto
which Uncle Maxim had already inscribed on
his pupil’s standard.</p>

<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>After that first excursion in the spring, the
boy was delirious for several days. He either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
lay quiet and motionless upon his bed, or kept
up a constant muttering, as if he were listening
to something. Meanwhile the peculiar expression
of wonder never left his face.</p>

<p>“He really looks as if he were trying in
vain to understand something,” said the young
mother.</p>

<p>Maxim had grown thoughtful; he merely
nodded. He had suspected that the boy’s
strange alarm, as well as his swoon, might be
attributed to the numerous impressions which
the boy’s perceptive faculties had been unable
to grasp; and he decided to allow these impressions
to find their way into the mind of the
convalescent child by degrees, disintegrated, so
to speak, into their component parts. The
windows of the invalid’s room had been closed,
but when he began to recover, they were occasionally
opened. Some member of the family
used to lead him about the rooms, and into the
vestibule, the yard, and the garden. Every time
his mother observed a look of alarm upon his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
face, she would explain to him the nature of the
sounds that perplexed him. “That is the shepherd’s
horn you hear beyond the wood,” she
explained; “and that sound which you hear
above the twittering of the sparrows is the note
of the red-wing. Listen to the stork gurgling
on his wheel.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> He has just arrived from distant
lands, and is now building his nest on the
old spot.”</p>

<p>As the mother spoke thus, the boy turned
toward her, his face beaming with gratitude, and
seized her hand and nodded, as with a thoughtful
and intelligent expression he continued
to listen.</p>

<h3>IX.</h3>

<p>Now, when anything attracted his attention
he always asked what it meant; and his mother,
or more frequently Uncle Maxim, would explain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
to him the nature of the objects or of the creatures
that caused these various sounds. His
mother’s explanations, more lively and graphic,
impressed the boy with greater force; but
sometimes this impression would be too painful.
Upon the features of the young woman, herself
suffering, could be read the expression of her
inmost feelings, and in her eyes a silent protest
or a look of pain, as she strove to convey to the
child an idea of form and color. With contracted
brow and wrinkled forehead the boy
concentrated his whole attention. Evidently
his brain was at work struggling with difficult
problems; his unpractised imagination strove
to shape from the descriptions given him a new
image,—a feat which it was unable to perform.
At such times Uncle Maxim always frowned with
displeasure; and when the tears appeared in
the mother’s eyes, and the child’s face grew pale
from the effect of his intense effort, Maxim
would interfere, and taking his sister’s place
would tell his nephew stories, in the invention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
of which he would try to use only such ideas as
related to sound and space. Then the face of
the blind boy would grow calmer.</p>

<p>“And is he big?” the child asked about the
stork, who seemed to be beating in his nest a
slow tattoo. Saying this he began to spread
out his arms; for this was his custom whenever
he asked such questions, and Uncle Maxim
would always tell him when he had extended
them far enough. But this time he had
stretched out his little arms to their utmost
limit, and Uncle Maxim said,—</p>

<p>“No, he is still larger. If he were brought
into this room and put upon the floor, his head
would reach above the back of the chair.”</p>

<p>“He <em>is</em> large,” said the boy thoughtfully;
“and the red-wing is like this,” slightly parting
his folded palms.</p>

<p>“Yes, the red-wing is like this. But the large
birds never sing so well as little ones. The red-wing
tries to make everybody pleased to hear
him, but the stork is a serious bird; he stands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
on one leg in his nest, and looks about like an
angry master watching his workmen, and mutters
aloud, heeding not that his voice is hoarse,
and that he can be overheard by outsiders.”</p>

<p>The boy laughed merrily while he listened to
these descriptions, and for a time forgot his
painful efforts to understand his mother’s words.
Yet her stories possessed a greater charm for
him, and he preferred to question her rather
than Uncle Maxim.</p>

</div>

<p>Thus the dark mind of the
child was gradually enriched by new images.
By means of his abnormally keen sense of
hearing he was enabled to penetrate deeper
and deeper into the secrets of Nature. The
dense, impenetrable gloom that veiled his brain
like a heavy cloud still enfolded him, and although
he had felt this from his birth, and one
might suppose that he would have become
accustomed to his misfortune, yet such was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the temperament of the child that he instinctively
strove to free himself from this dark
curtain. His perpetual though unconscious
efforts to gain that light of which he knew
not, had left upon his face the impress of his
vague and painful struggle.</p>

<p>Yet the blind boy enjoyed moments of quiet
satisfaction, even of childish delight, which
came to him whenever he received a keen sensation
from certain outward impressions, revealing
unfamiliar manifestations of the unseen
world. Nature in all her grandeur and power
was not wholly inaccessible to him. Once, for
instance, when he was led to a high cliff above
the river, he listened with a peculiar expression
to the far-away splashing of the water below,
and when he heard the stones slipping from beneath
his feet he seized his mother’s dress and
held his breath in fear. From that time depth
was represented to him by the gentle murmuring
of water at the foot of a cliff, or by the startling
sound of stones falling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>A remote and indistinct song conveyed to the
mind of the boy the idea of distance; but when
during a storm in the spring-time the pealing
thunder rang out, filling all the air with its reverberations
and angry mutterings, gradually dying
away amid the clouds, he listened with awe, his
heart swelling with emotion, and in his mind
arose a grand conception of the magnitude of
the firmament. Thus sound embodied for the
child the immediate expression of the outside
world; all other impressions were merely supplementary
to that of hearing, by whose aid his
ideas took form as if poured into a mould.</p>

<p>Sometimes during the heat of noonday,
when all around was quiet, when human life
seemed at a standstill, and Nature had lapsed
into that peculiar repose beneath which the
noiseless current of life is felt rather than seen,
the face of the blind boy likewise assumed
an expression peculiar to himself. He seemed
like one absorbed in listening to sounds inaudible
to all the world beside,—sounds issuing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
from the depths of his own soul, impelled to
utterance by the universal calm. One who
observed him at such moments might fancy that
his vague thoughts had found an echo in his
heart, like the uncertain melody of a song.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>The blind boy was already five years old.
Slender and frail he was, it is true, but still he
could walk and even run with ease and freedom
around the house. No stranger on seeing him
walk with such entire confidence from room to
room, always turning at the right place and finding
what he sought, would for one moment have
suspected that the boy was blind; he would
simply have been taken for a child intensely in
earnest, ever with a far-away look in his eyes.
But in the yard he moved with less confidence,
feeling his way by the aid of his cane. If it so
chanced that he had no cane in his hand, he
chose rather to creep upon the ground, passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
his hands rapidly over every object that came
in his way.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>It was a calm summer evening. Uncle Maxim
was sitting in the garden. The father as usual
was occupied in some distant field. Everything
was quiet in the yard and around the house; the
hamlet was to all appearances going to sleep,
and the hum of the servants’ and workmen’s
voices had likewise ceased.</p>

<p>The boy had already been in bed for half an
hour. He lay between sleeping and waking. For
a certain length of time this peaceful hour had
seemed to arouse strange memories within him.
Of course he could see neither the dusky blue
sky, nor the dark waving tree-tops, outlined
sharp and clear against the starry heavens, nor
the frowning peaks of the courtyard buildings,
nor the blue haze overspreading the ground, mingling
with the pale golden light of the moon and
the stars. For several days he had fallen asleep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
under the charm of a spell of which he could
render no account the following day. When
drowsiness had benumbed his senses, when he
could no longer hear the rustle of the beech-trees,
or the distant barking of the village dogs,
or the voice of the nightingale beyond the river,
or the melancholy tinkling of the bells attached
to the colt browsing in the neighboring field,—when
all these varied sounds grew faint and indistinct,
it seemed to the blind boy that they
were all merged in one harmonious melody,
which made its way quietly into the room, and
hovering over his bed brought in its train vague
but enticing dreams. The next morning when
he woke he still felt their influence, and asked
his mother: “What was that—yesterday? What
was it?”</p>

<p>The mother did not know what her child
meant; she thought he was probably excited by
some dream. That night she put him to bed
herself, and when she saw that he was on the
point of falling asleep, she left him without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
observing anything unusual. But on the following
day the boy again spoke to her of something
he had heard the previous evening which had
made him feel so happy. “It was lovely,
mamma,—so lovely! What was it?”</p>

<p>That night the mother decided to remain
longer by her child’s bedside, to discover if possible
the solution to this strange riddle. She sat
in a chair beside the crib, knitting mechanically,
listening meanwhile to the even breathing of her
Petrùsya.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> She thought he was asleep, when suddenly
his gentle voice was heard in the darkness:</p>

<p>“Mamma, are you there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, my boy!”</p>

<p>“Please go away; <em>it</em> must be afraid of you;
<em>it</em> has not come. I had almost dropped to
sleep, and still <em>it</em> has not come.”</p>

<p>The astonished mother heard the child’s
drowsy and plaintive whisper with a strange sensation.
He spoke of his dreams in the most
perfect good faith, as though they were reality.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Nevertheless the mother rose, bent down to kiss
him, and then quietly left the room; but she
determined to creep cautiously round to the
open window that looked out into the garden.
Before she succeeded in carrying her plan into
execution, the riddle was solved. Suddenly
from the stable came the soft musical tones of a
shepherd’s pipe, blending with the gentle rustling
sounds of the southern evening. She had
no difficulty in divining the pleasing influence
which these simple modulations of an artless
melody, harmonizing with the witching hour of
dreams, would naturally possess over the imagination
of her boy. She herself paused, and
stood for a moment listening to the tender
strains of a song of Little Russia, and with a sense
of relief entered the dusky garden in search of
Uncle Maxim.</p>

<p>“Joachim plays well,” the mother thought.
“It is strange that this fellow who seems
so rough should possess such an amount of
feeling.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>Joachim really did play well. He could even
handle the more intricate violin, and there had
been a time when on a Sunday at the inn no one
had played the Cossack dance or the merry
Polish Cracovienne better than himself. When
seated on a cask with the violin braced against
his shaven chin, and his tall sheepskin hat on
the back of his head, he would draw the bow
across the quivering strings, hardly a man in the
inn could keep his seat. Even the old one-eyed
Jew who accompanied Joachim on a bass-viol
would wax enthusiastic, his awkward instrument
with its heavy bass straining every nerve, as it
were, to keep time with the light notes of Joachim’s
violin, which seemed to dance as well as
sing; while old Yankel himself, with his skull-cap
on his head, would lift his shoulders and
turn his bald head, keeping time with his body
to the gay capricious tune. It would hardly be
worth while to describe the effect upon others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
whose feet are so made that at the very first note
of a dancing tune they involuntarily begin to
shuffle and stamp.</p>

<p>Ever since Joachim had fallen in love with
Màrya, a courtyard servant-maid of the neighboring
Pan, he had neglected his merry violin.
In truth it had not helped him to win the heart
of the saucy Màrya, who preferred the smooth
German face of her master’s valet to the bearded
visage of the musician. Since that time his
violin had not been heard either in the inn or
at the evening gatherings. He had hung it on
a nail in the stable, nor did he seem aware
that from dampness and neglect the strings of
the instrument, once so dear to his heart,
were constantly snapping with a sound so
sharp, plaintive, and dismal that the very horses
neighed in sympathy, and turned their heads to
gaze in wonder at their indifferent master. In
order to supply its place, Joachim had purchased
from a travelling Carpathian mountaineer a
wooden pipe. He probably expected to find it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
a more suitable medium wherewith to express
the sorrow of a rejected heart, and that its
sympathetic modulations would harmonize with
his hard lot. But the mountain pipe disappointed
Joachim’s expectations. He tried nearly
a dozen of them in turn, in every possible way;
he cut them, soaked them in water, dried them
in the sun, hung them up under the roof to dry
in the wind,—but all to no avail. The mountain
pipe did not commend itself to the
Hohòl’s<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> heart. It whistled where it should
have sung, wailed when he wanted a sentimental
tremolo, and never in fact responded to his
mood.</p>

<p>At last Joachim grew disgusted with all the
wandering mountaineers, having made up his
mind that not one of them understood the art
of producing a good pipe, and decided to
manufacture one with his own hands. For several
days he roamed with frowning brow through
swamp and field; went up to every willow bush,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
examined its branches, occasionally cut off one
of them; but he failed to find just what he
needed. With sternly frowning brow he still
pursued his search, and came at last to a spot
above the slowly running river, where the placid
waters barely stirred the lilies’ snow-white
heads. This nook was sheltered from the wind
by a dense growth of spreading willows that
hung their pensive heads over the dusky and
peaceful depths below. Parting the bushes,
Joachim made his way down to the river, where
he paused for a moment; and the idea suddenly
came to him that this was the very spot
where he was to find the object of his search.
The wrinkles vanished from his brow. From
his boot-leg he drew out a knife with a string
attached to it, and after carefully examining a
faintly whispering young willow, he unhesitatingly
selected a straight and slender stalk that
bent over the steep, crumbling shore. Tapping
it with his finger for some purpose of his own,
a look of self-satisfaction came upon his face, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
he watched it sway to and fro in the air, and
listened to the gentle murmur of its leaves.</p>

<p>“That is the very thing,” he muttered, nodding
with delight, as he threw into the river the
twigs he had previously cut.</p>

<p>It proved to be a glorious pipe. Having
dried the willow, Joachim burned out the pith
with a red-hot wire; and boring six round holes,
he cut the seventh crosswise and tightly closed
one end with a wooden plug, across which he
cut a narrow slit. Then for a week he hung
the pipe up by a slender string, that it might be
warmed by the sun and dried by the wind;
after which he carefully cleaned it with his
knife, scraped it with glass, and rubbed it hard
with a piece of cloth. The upper part of the
pipe was round; on its smoothly polished surface
he burned with a twisted bit of iron all
sorts of curious designs. When he at last tested
his instrument by playing upon it several tones
of the scale, he nodded his head excitedly,
emitted a grunt of satisfaction, and hastily hid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
it in a safe place near his bed. He did not like
to make the first musical trial amid the turmoil
of the day; but that very evening, trills delicately
modulated, tender, pensive, and vibrating,
might have been heard from the direction of
the stable. Joachim was perfectly satisfied with
his pipe. It seemed a part of himself; its utterances
came, as it were, from his own enthusiastic
and sentimental bosom; and every change
of feeling, every shade of sorrow, was forthwith
transmitted to his wonderful pipe, which in its
turn repeated it in gentle echoes to the listening
evening.</p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>Now, Joachim in love with his pipe was celebrating
his honey-moon. In the daytime he
conscientiously fulfilled his duties as a stable-boy,—watered
the horses, harnessed them, and
drove with the Pani or with Maxim. Sometimes,
when he looked over toward the neighboring
village where the cruel Màrya lived, his heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
was conscious of a pang. But as evening
drew on, all his woes were forgotten; even the
image of the dark-browed maiden lost distinctness,
as it stood before him enveloped in mist,
faintly outlined against a pale background, serving
but to lend a certain pensive melancholy
to his melodious pipe.</p>

<p>As he lay in the stable that evening, Joachim’s
musical ecstasy found vent in tremulous melodies.
The musician had not only forgotten the
cruel beauty, but had even lost all consciousness
of his own existence, when suddenly he
started and sprang up in bed, leaning on his
elbow. Just when his notes were growing most
pathetic, he felt a tiny hand pass swiftly and
lightly over his face and hands, and then with
equal swiftness over the pipe. At the same
time he heard by his side the rapid panting of
one whose breathing is quickened by agitation.
“Begone, away with you!” he uttered the usual
exhortation, and immediately added the question:
“Are you the good or the evil spirit?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
that he might know if it were the Evil with
whom he had to deal. But a moonbeam that
had just crept into the stable showed him his
mistake. Beside him stood the small Pan, wistfully
stretching forth his little hands.</p>

<p>An hour later, the mother on going to take a
look at her sleeping Petrùsya did not find him
in bed. For a moment she was startled, but the
maternal instinct directly told her where to look
for the lost boy. Joachim, pausing for a moment,
was quite abashed at the unexpected
sight of the “gracious Pani” standing in the
doorway of the stable. It appeared that she
had been there for several moments before he
ceased playing, watching her boy, who sat on
the cot wrapped in Joachim’s sheepskin coat,
listening intently for the interrupted melody.</p>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>From that evening the boy came to Joachim
in the stable every night. It never occurred to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
him to ask Joachim to play for him during the
daytime; he seemed to fancy that the stir and
bustle of the day precluded all possibility of
these sweet melodies. But as soon as the shades
of evening began to fall, Petrùsya was seized
with a feverish impatience. The evening tea
and supper served but as signs of the approach
of the longed-for moment; and the mother, although
she felt an instinctive aversion for those
musical séances, still could not forbid her darling
to seek the company of the piper and spend
two hours with him in the stable before bedtime.
Those hours became for the boy the happiest of
his life; and the mother saw with painful jealousy
that the impressions of the previous evening
held entire possession of the child; that during
the day he no longer responded to her caresses
with his former ardor; that while sitting in her
lap with his arms about her, his thoughts would
revert to Joachim’s song of the previous
evening.</p>

<p>It suddenly occurred to the mother that while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
she was in the <i lang="fr">pension</i> of Pani Radètzka, several
years ago, she had among other “delightful
accomplishments” pursued the study of music.
This reminiscence was not in itself a source of
delight, because it was connected with the memory
of her teacher,—one Klapps; a lean, prosy,
and irritable old German Fräulein. This bilious
maiden, who in order to impart to the fingers of
her pupils the required flexibility, had trained
them most skilfully, succeeded at the same
time in destroying every vestige of poetical
and musical feeling. The very presence of
Pani Klapps, not to mention her pedantic
method, was well calculated to abash so sensitive
an emotion. Therefore after leaving
school, and even since her marriage, Anna
Michàilovna had felt no inclination to renew
her musical studies. But now, as she listened
to the piper, she was conscious that in addition
to the emotion of jealousy a sense of
appreciation and feeling for the living melody
had sprung up in her soul, and the image of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the German Fräulein was almost forgotten.
The result of this was that Pani Popèlska requested
her husband to send to town for an
upright piano.</p>

<p>“If you wish it, my dove,” replied the exemplary
husband. “I thought you did not care
much about music.”</p>

<p>That same day a letter was sent to town; but
several weeks must elapse before the instrument
could arrive in the country.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the same harmonious strains proceeded
from the stable evening after evening;
and the boy, who had ceased to ask his mother’s
permission, hurried eagerly thither at the proper
time. With the customary odor of the stable
was mingled the fragrance of the hay and the
pungent smell of the leather harnesses; and
whenever the piper paused for a moment one
could hear the faint rustling of the wisps of hay
which the horses, quietly munching, pulled
through the bars, and also the whispering of the
green beeches in the garden. In the midst of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
all this Pètrik<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> sat listening like one enchanted.
He never interrupted the musician; but once
when the latter had been resting, and several
minutes had passed in absolute silence, the
charmèd influence that possessed the boy gave
way to a passionate yearning. He reached to
grasp the pipe, took it in his trembling hands,
and carried it to his lips. Gasping for breath,
his first notes were faint and tremulous, but
by slow degrees he gained a certain mastery
over the simple instrument. Joachim placed
the boy’s fingers on the holes, and although
the tiny hand could hardly grasp them, he
had very soon mastered the notes of the scale.
Every note possessed to him an individuality
of its own; he knew in which opening he
should find each of these tones, whence to
bring it forth; and at times when Joachim
was quietly and slowly playing some simple
melody, the blind boy’s fingers would imitate
his movements. As tone followed tone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
he seemed to know exactly from which hole
each one came.</p>

<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>At last, after three weeks had gone by, the
piano was brought from town. Pétya<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> stood in
the yard and listened attentively, in order to
discover how the workmen hurrying to and fro
would carry “the music” into the rooms.
Surely it must be very heavy, for when they
lifted it down from the cart there was a creaking
noise, and also much groaning and puffing
among the men. And now he could hear their
heavy, measured tread; and at every step there
was a jarring, a rumbling, and a ringing above
their heads. When this strange music was
placed on the drawing-room floor, it again sent
forth a dull rumbling sound like the threatening
tones of an angry voice.</p>

<p>All this alarmed the boy and by no means
attracted him toward this new guest, at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
inanimate and wrathful. He went into the
garden, and thus he missed hearing them set
up the instrument; neither did he know when
the tuner, who had arrived from town, tuned it
with his tuning-hammer, tried the key-board,
and tightened the wires. It was not until all
was in readiness that the mother ordered Pétya
to be brought into the room.</p>

<p>With the best Vienna instrument as an auxiliary,
Anna Michàilovna felt confident of victory
over the simple rustic pipe. Now her Pétya is
to forget the stable and the piper, and she will
once more become the source of all his joys.
She glanced merrily at her boy as he timidly
entered the room, accompanied by Uncle
Maxim and Joachim; the latter, having asked
leave to listen to the foreign music, with down-cast
eyes and overhanging forelock now stood
bashfully in the doorway. Just as Uncle Maxim
and Pétya seated themselves on the lounge
Anna suddenly struck the keys of the piano.
She played the piece that she had learned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
perfection at the <i lang="fr">pension</i> of Pani Radètzka, under
the instruction of Fräulein Klapps. It was
not a particularly brilliant piece, but quite complicated,
and one that required a certain amount
of dextrous fingering; at the public examination
Anna Michàilovna gained much praise, both
for herself and her teacher, by the playing of
this piece. No one positively knew, but many
surmised, that the silent Pan Popèlski was first
charmed with Pani Yatzènko during the identical
quarter of an hour required for the performance
of her difficult music. <em>Now</em> the young
woman played it with the view of winning a
second victory: she wished to bind still more
closely to herself her son’s young heart, enticed
away from her by the pipe of the Hohòl.</p>

<p>But the fond mother’s hope was doomed to
disappointment; the Vienna instrument proved
no match for the willow twig of Ukraine. True,
the piano from Vienna was rich in resources,—expensive
wood, fine strings, the skilled workmanship
of a Vienna artisan, and all the wealth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
of its wide musical range; but the pipe of the
Ukraine had allies of its own,—it was in its
native haunts, surrounded by its own Ukraine
nature. Before Joachim had cut it with his
knife and burned out its heart with red-hot iron,
it had swung to and fro above the river, so dear
to the boy’s heart; it had been caressed by the
sun of the Ukraine, and fanned by its breezes
until the keen eye of the piper had caught sight
of it overhanging the precipice. The foreign
visitor had but a slender chance against the
simple native pipe, whose tones had first been
heard by the boy at the peaceful hour of bedtime,
through the mysterious rustling of the
night and the murmuring of the green beech-trees,
with all the well-known voices of Nature
in the Ukraine that found an echo within his
soul.</p>

<p>There could, moreover, be no fair comparison
between Pani Popèlska and Joachim. Her fingers,
it is true, were more dextrous and flexible;
the melody she played was richer and more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
complex; and Fräulein Klapps had labored diligently
to make her pupil mistress of this difficult
instrument. But Joachim had the true musical
instinct. He had loved also, and sorrowed;
and animated by these emotions, he sought his
themes in the surrounding Nature, and there he
found his simple melodies,—the soughing of
the forest, the gentle whisper of the grass upon
the steppes, the sad, old, national melodies that
he had heard sung over his crib when he was an
infant.</p>

<p>The instrument from Vienna had truly but a
slender chance against the magic of the Hohòl’s
pipe. Not more than a minute had passed
before Uncle Maxim with sudden energy rapped
on the floor with his crutch. When Anna
Michàilovna turned toward him, she saw on
Pètrik’s pale face the same expression it had
worn as he lay upon the grass on the memorable
day of their first spring walk. Joachim in
his turn looked sympathetically at the boy, then
with one disdainful glance at the German music<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
he left the room, his heavy boots resounding
across the drawing-room floor.</p>

<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>Many a tear and no slight mortification did
this failure cost the poor mother. She, “the
gracious Pani Popèlska,” who had been applauded
by a “select audience,” to find herself
so utterly defeated,—and by whom? By a
common stable-boy, Joachim, with his absurd
pipe! As she remembered the disdainful
glance of the Hohòl when her unsuccessful concert
came to an end, an angry blush overspread
her face, and she felt an actual hatred for the
“detestable fellow.” But every evening when
her boy hastened to the stable, she would open
the window, rest her elbows on the sill, and
listen intently. At first it was with a feeling of
angry disdain that she sought to catch that
“stupid squeaking;” but gradually,—she knew
not how it came to pass,—the “stupid squeaking”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
had taken possession of her soul, and she
found herself eagerly devouring those mournful
and pathetic strains. When she woke to a
realizing sense of this, she began to wonder
whence came their fascination, their enchanting
mystery; and by degrees, the bluish dusk of
evening, the vague shadows of the night, and
the harmony existing between those melodies
and Nature revealed the secret. No longer resisting
the attraction, she confessed to herself,—</p>

<p>“Yes, I must admit that this humble music
does possess a rare and genuine feeling,—a
bewitching poetry not to be acquired by notes.”</p>

<p>This was indeed true. The secret of this
poetry might be found in the intimate relation
between Nature and those memories of the past
of which it was ever whispering to the human
heart. Joachim, the rude peasant, with his
greasy boots and calloused hands, possessed
that harmonious, that keen feeling for Nature.</p>

<p>Then the mother became aware that her
haughty spirit had succumbed before the stable-boy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
She no longer remembered his coarse
garments, redolent of tar; but the pleasing modulations
of the songs recalled to mind his kind
face, the mild expression of his gray eyes, and
the bashful, humorous smile that lurked under the
long mustache. Yet again the angry color rose,
overspreading the face and temples of the young
woman: she was conscious that in this struggle
for her child’s admiration she had placed herself
on a level with this “varlet,” and that he,
“the varlet,” had conquered. The whispering
trees in the garden high above her head, the
light of the stars in the dark-blue sky, the violet
mist that shrouded the earth, together with
Joachim’s melodies, all contributed to fill the
mother’s soul with gentle melancholy. Her
spirit yielded itself in meek submission, and
entered more and more deeply into the mystery
of that pure, direct, and simple poetry of Nature.</p>

<p>Yes, the peasant Joachim had the true, living
feeling! And how was it with the mother herself?
Was she entirely devoid of that feeling?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Why then did her heart beat so wildly, and why
did the tears rise to her eyes? Did not her
emotion spring from her devoted love for her
unfortunate blind child, who left her for Joachim
because she failed to give him as keen a pleasure
as the latter? She remembered the expression
of distress on the boy’s face caused by her playing,
and hot tears gushed from her eyes; it was
with difficulty that she controlled her suffocating
sobs.</p>

<p>The poor mother! It seemed as if an incurable
malady had settled upon her, revealing its
presence by an exaggerated tenderness at every
manifestation of suffering on the part of the
child, and a mysterious sympathy which by a
thousand invisible chords bound her aching
heart to his. For this reason, the strange rivalry
between herself and the Hohòl piper,
which in a woman of different nature would
merely have stirred a feeling of annoyance, became
for her a source of bitter, exaggerated
suffering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus time went on, without bringing the fond
mother any apparent relief; and yet she was
gradually gaining a certain advantage. She began
to feel within her own breast an influx of
melody and poetry, not unlike that which had attracted
her in the playing of the Hohòl. Hope,
too, sprang up in her heart. Under the influence
of this sudden access of confidence she
approached the piano several times, and opened
it, intending to overpower the low-voiced pipe
by harmonious chords. But every time a sense
of irresolution and timidity restrained her. She
remembered her boy’s distressed face, and the
disdainful glance of the Hohòl; and dark as it
was, her cheeks flushed with shame, while with
timid wistfulness she let her hands flutter over
the keys.</p>

<p>Still, day by day an inner consciousness of her
own power grew within the woman’s heart;
and choosing the time when her boy was playing
in the evening in some remote garden-path,
or perhaps out for a walk, she would seat herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
at the piano. At first her attempts were unsatisfactory;
her hands seemed powerless to evoke
a response to her conception, and the tones of
the instrument failed to interpret her emotions.
But soon she perceived that the ease and freedom
with which she could express her feelings
through the medium of those tones were gradually
increasing. The Hohòl’s lessons had not
been without avail; while the mother’s love, and
an intuitive perception of the potent charm that
swayed the heart of her boy helped her to profit
by them. Her difficult and brilliant themes had
given place to pensive songs; the sad Ukraine
“meditation” echoed in plaintive tones through
the dimly lighted rooms, adding a tenderness to
the mother’s heart.</p>

<p>At last she gained confidence to enter into an
open contest; and one evening a strange combat
went on between the manor and the stable.
From the shaded barn with its overhanging
thatch, gently quivering, came the trills of the
pipe, while advancing to the encounter from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
open windows of the mansion, glittering in the
moonlight through the leaves of the beech-trees,
echoed the full ringing chords of the
piano. At first neither the boy nor Joachim,
prejudiced as they were, deigned to pay any attention
to the “learned” music of the mansion.
The boy even frowned when Joachim paused,
and impatiently urged him on, saying,—</p>

<p>“Come, play! Go on playing!”</p>

<p>Three days had not gone by when these
pauses grew more and more frequent. Joachim
often laid his pipe aside to listen, and the boy,
forgetting to urge his friend, listened also.
Finally Joachim said in a dreamy sort of way,
“That is fine! Listen! that is a fine thing!”
And then in his dreamy, absent-minded way
he took the boy in his arms and carried him
through the garden to the open window of the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>Joachim supposed that the “gracious Pani”
was playing for her own amusement, and would
take no notice of them. But Anna Michàilovna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
had become aware that her rival, the pipe, had
been silenced; she realized her victory, and her
heart beat with pride and joy. Moreover, her
displeasure with Joachim had entirely vanished.
She knew that she owed her present happiness
to him,—he had shown her how to regain the
devotion of her child; and if her boy were now
to receive from her new and valuable impressions,
they would both owe a debt of gratitude
to their teacher, the peasant piper.</p>

<h3>IX.</h3>

<p>The ice was broken. On the following day
the boy with timid curiosity came into the drawing-room,
where he had not been since the new
city guest—that angry, loud-voiced creature—had
taken possession of the room. But yesterday
he heard the guest sing a song that pleased
his ear, and gave him cause to change his opinion
of the instrument. With the last lingering
traces of his former timidity he drew near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
the spot where the piano stood, and stopping
at a short distance from it, he listened. There
was no one in the drawing-room. His mother
sat on a sofa in the adjoining room, sewing;
she held her breath as she watched him, admiring
every movement, every change of expression
on his sensitive face.</p>

<p>Putting out his hand, the blind boy touched
the polished surface of the piano; then overcome
by bashfulness, he immediately withdrew
it. Having twice repeated this experiment he
drew nearer, and began a careful examination
of the instrument, stooping to the floor to pass
his hand over the legs, and feeling his way as
far around its sides as he could go. At last his
hand touched the smooth key-board: the soft
reverberation of the string vibrated uncertainly
on the air. The boy listened to this vibration
long after it had ceased to be audible to his
mother; then with a look of intense interest he
touched another key. Presently, as he drew
his hand along the key-board, he happened to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
touch a note of the upper register; then he
touched every note, one after the other, and
paused to listen as they vibrated in trembling
cadence and were lost in the air. The face of
the blind boy wore an expression of mingled
attention and delight; he evidently enjoyed
every separate tone, and by this sensitive observation
of each elementary sound as component
parts of melodies yet unborn, the future artist
might be divined.</p>

<p>But it seemed as if each note possessed for
the blind boy an attribute peculiar to itself.
When beneath the pressure of his finger a brilliant
note of the upper register rang out, a glow
would come upon his face, uplifted as if to follow
the ringing note in its upward flight; but
when he touched a deep bass-note, he stooped
to listen,—seeming to feel sure that the heavy
note must be rolling along the ground, scattering
itself all over the floor, to be finally lost in
the corners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<h3>X.</h3>

<p>Uncle Maxim simply tolerated all these musical
experiments. Strange though it may seem,
the inclinations which had so unmistakably manifested
themselves in the boy excited mingled
emotions in the breast of the old soldier. On
the one hand, this intense passion for music
indicated the boy’s inherent musical talent, and
foreshadowed a possible career; but in spite of
this, a vague sense of disappointment filled Uncle
Maxim’s heart.</p>

<p>“It cannot be denied,” thus ran Maxim’s
thoughts, “that music is a power by which a
man may sway the hearts of the multitude. He,
the blind man, will attract dandies and fashionable
women by the hundreds, will play a valse
or a nocturne,”—here Uncle Maxim’s musical
vocabulary came suddenly to an end,—“and
they will wipe away their tears with their delicate
handkerchiefs. Ah, the deuce take it! that is
not what I could have wished for him. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
what’s to be done about it? The fellow is
blind; he must do what he can with his life.
But if it had only been singing! A song speaks
not alone to the fastidious ear,—it excites fancies,
arouses thoughts in the mind, and kindles
courage in the heart.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Joachim,” Uncle Maxim said
one evening, as he followed the blind boy into
the stable, “do for once stop that whistling!
It might do well enough for a street urchin, or
for the shepherd boy in the field; but you are
a grown-up peasant, although that silly Màrya
has made a calf of you. Fie! I am really
ashamed of you! The lass proved hard-hearted,
and that has made you so soft that you whistle
like a quail caught in a net.”</p>

<p>As he listened in the darkness to this sharp
tirade from the Pan, Joachim smiled at his unnecessary
indignation. But he did feel somewhat
wounded by his allusion to the street
urchin and the shepherd boy, and replied,—</p>

<p>“Don’t say that, Pan! Not a shepherd in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the Ukraine has a pipe like that, let alone the
shepherd boy. Theirs are nothing but whistles;
but mine—just listen!” He closed all the
openings with his fingers, and struck the two
notes of the octave, drinking in as he did so
the fullness of the tones.</p>

<p>Maxim spat. “The Lord have mercy on us,
the lad has lost his wits! What do I care for
your pipe? They are all alike, both pipes and
women, with your Màrya into the bargain!
You had better sing us a song, if you know
how,—a good song of our fathers’ or grandfathers’.”</p>

<p>Maxim Yatzènko, a Little Russian himself,
was simple and unassuming in his manners
toward peasants and servants. Although he
often scolded and shouted at them, he never
hurt any man’s feelings; and while his inferiors
were on familiar terms with him, they never
failed to treat him with respect. Hence to the
Pan’s request, Joachim replied,—</p>

<p>“Why not? I used to sing as well as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
next man. But, Pan, do you think our peasant
songs are likely to please you?” he asked,
slightly sarcastic.</p>

<p>“Eh, what nonsense, fellow!” replied Maxim.
“A pipe cannot be compared with a good song,
if only a man can sing well. Let us listen to
Joachim’s song, Petrùsya. But only you may
not understand it, my boy.”</p>

<p>“Is it to be a peasant’s song?” inquired the
boy. “I understand their language.”</p>

<p>Maxim heaved a sigh. “Ah, my dear boy,
these are not slave songs; they are the songs of
a strong and free people. Your mother’s ancestors
sang them on the steppes of the Dnièper,
the Danube, and the Black Sea. Well, you
will understand them sooner or later, but just
now I am anxious about something else.”</p>

<p>In point of fact, what Maxim really feared
was that the picturesque language of the folk-songs
would not appeal to the vaguely obscure
mind of the child; he felt that the animated
music of epic song must be interpreted to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
heart by familiar images. He forgot that the
old bards, the singers and bandur-players of the
Ukraine, were for the most part blind men,
who had been driven by misfortune or physical
incapacity to the lyre, or bandur, to gain their
daily bread. It is true that these men were but
beggars and artisans with harsh voices, some of
whom had not become blind until they were old
men. Blindness wraps the outer world about
with a dark veil, which likewise envelops the
brain, entangling and impeding its processes;
and yet by the aid of inherited conceptions
and impressions gained from other sources,
the brain creates in this darkness a world of
its own, sad, gloomy, and sombre, but not
devoid of a vague poetry peculiar to itself.</p>

<p>Maxim and the blind boy seated themselves
on the hay, while Joachim reclined on his
bench,—a position which seemed especially
conducive to his artistic efforts,—and after
musing for a moment he began to sing.
Whether by chance or by instinct, his choice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
was a happy one. He selected a historical
picture,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Over yonder on the hill the reapers are reaping.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>No one who has heard this beautiful song
well rendered can ever forget its strange melody,—high-pitched
and plaintive, as though
oppressed by the sadness of historical reminiscence.
It contains no stirring incidents, no
bloody battles or exploits; neither is it the farewell
of a Cossack to his beloved, nor a daring
invasion, nor a naval expedition on the blue sea
or the Danube. It is but a fleeting picture that
comes uppermost in the memory of a Little Russian,
like a vague revery, like the fragment of a
dream from an historic past. In the midst of
his monotonous, every-day life that picture rises
before his imagination, its outlines dim and indistinct,
steeped in the strange melancholy that
breathes from bygone days,—days that have
left their impress on the memory of man. The
lofty burial-mounds beneath which lie the bones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
of the Cossacks, where fires are seen burning at
midnight, where groans are sometimes heard,
still remind us of the past. The popular legends
as well as the folk-songs, now fast dying
out, also tell us of the past.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Over yonder on the hill the reapers are reaping,</div>
<div class="verse">And beneath the hill, the green hill,</div>
<div class="verse indent6">Cossacks are passing,</div>
<div class="verse indent6">Cossacks are passing!</div>
<div class="verse">They are reaping on the hill, while below the troops are marching.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Maxim Yatzènko was lost in admiration of
the sad song. That charming melody, so well
suited to the words, called up before his fancy
a scene illumined by the melancholy rays of
sunset. Along the peaceful slopes of the hill-sides
he seemed to see the bowed and silent
figures of the reapers, and below moving noiselessly,
one after the other, the ranks of the
army, blending with the shades of evening in
the valley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Doroshenko<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> at the head,</div>
<div class="verse">Leading his army, his Zaporòg army</div>
<div class="verse indent4">Gallantly.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And the prolonged note of the epic song resounds,
vibrates, and dies away upon the air,
only to start forth anew, evoking fresh images
from the dim twilight. These were the pictures
which at the bidding of the song took form in
Uncle Maxim’s mind; and the blind boy, who
had listened with a sad and clouded face, was
also impressed by it after his own fashion.</p>

<p>When the singer sang of the hill where the
reapers were reaping, Petrùsya was straightway
transported in his imagination to the summit
of the familiar cliff. He recognizes it by the
faint plashing of the river against the stones below.
He knows very well what reapers are,—he
has heard the ringing sound of the sickles
and the rustle of the falling ears. But when the
song went on to describe the action under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
hill, the imagination of the blind listener at once
transported him into the valley below. Though
he no longer hears the sound of the sickles, the
boy knows that the reapers are still up there on
the hill, and he knows that the sound has died
away, because they are so high above him,—as
high as the pine-trees, whose rustling he
hears when he stands on the cliff; and below,
over the river, echoes the rapid monotonous
tramp of the horses’ hoofs. There are many
of them, and an indistinct murmur rises through
the darkness from under the hill. Those are
the Cossacks “on the march.”</p>

<p>Petrùsya also knows what “Cossacks” means.
The Cossack Hvèydka,<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> who sometimes stops
at the house, is called by everybody “the old
Cossack.” Many a time has he lifted Petrùsya
to his lap and smoothed his hair with his trembling
hand. When the boy according to his
custom felt of his face, he found deep wrinkles
under his sensitive fingers, a long, drooping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
mustache and sunken cheeks, and on those
cheeks the tears of old age. It was such Cossacks
as he that the boy pictured to himself
marching below the hill. They are on horseback,
and like Hvèydka they wear long mustaches,
and are old and wrinkled too. These
vague forms advance slowly amid the darkness,
and like Hvèydka are weeping for grief. It
may be that the echo of Joachim’s song suggests
the lament of the unfortunate Cossack
who exchanged his young wife for a camp-bed
and the hardships of a campaign, as it rings
over hill and valley.</p>

<p>One glance was enough for Maxim to discover
that despite the boy’s blindness the poetic
images of the song appealed to his sensitive
nature.</p>

</div>

<p>In pursuance of the system
which by Maxim’s influence had been established,
the blind boy had as far as possible
been left to his own resources; and from this
system the best results had ensued. In the
house he showed no signs of helplessness, but
moved from place to place without faltering;
took care of his own room, and kept his belongings
and his toys in order. Neither did
Maxim by any means neglect physical exercises;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the boy had his regular gymnastics,
and in his sixth year Maxim presented his
nephew with a gentle little horse. At first
the mother could not believe it possible that
her blind child could ride on horseback, and
she called her brother’s scheme “perfect madness.”
But the old soldier exerted his utmost
influence and in two or three months the boy
was galloping merrily side by side with Joachim,
who directed him only at turnings.</p>

<p>Thus blindness proved no drawback to systematic
physical development, while its influence
over the moral nature of the child was reduced
to its minimum. He was tall for his age and
well built; his face was somewhat pale, his features
fine and expressive. His dark hair enhanced
the pallid hue of his complexion, while
his eyes—large, dark, and almost motionless—gave
him a peculiar aspect that at once attracted
attention. A slight wrinkle between his eye-brows,
a habit of inclining his head slightly
forward, and the expression of sadness that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
sometimes overcast his handsome face,—these
were the outward tokens of his blindness. When
surrounded by familiar objects he moved readily
and without restraint; but still it was evident
that his instinctive vivacity was repressed,
and it was only by certain fitful outbursts of nervous
excitement that it was ever manifested.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>The impressions received through the channels
of sound outweighed all others in their influence
over the life of the blind boy; his ideas shaped
themselves according to sounds, his sense of
hearing became the centre of his mental activity.
The enchanting melodies of the songs he heard
conveyed to him a true sense of the words,
coloring them with sadness or joy according to
the lights and shades of the melody. With
still closer attention he listened to the voices of
Nature; and by uniting these confused impressions
with the familiar melodies, he sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
produced a free improvisation, in which it was
difficult to distinguish just where the national
and familiar air ended and the work of the composer
began. He himself was unable to distinguish
these two elements in his songs, so
inseparably were the two united within him.
He quickly learned all his mother taught him on
the piano, and yet he still loved Joachim’s pipe.
The tones of the piano were richer, deeper, and
more brilliant; but the instrument was stationary,
whereas the pipe he could carry with him
into the fields; and its modulations were so indistinguishably
blended with the gentle sighs of
the steppe, that at times Petrùsya could not tell
whether those vague fancies were wafted on the
wind, or whether it was he himself who drew
them from his pipe.</p>

<p>Petrùsya’s enthusiasm for music became the
centre of his mental growth; it absorbed his
mind, and lent variety to his quiet life. Maxim
availed himself of it to make the boy acquainted
with the history of his native land; and like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
vast network of sounds, the procession filed
before the imagination of the blind boy.
Touched by the song, he learned to know the
heroes of whom it sung, and to feel a concern
for their fate and for the destiny of his country.
This was the beginning of his interest in literature;
and when he was nine years old, Maxim
began his first lessons. He had been studying
the methods used in the instruction of the blind,
and the boy showed great delight in the lessons.
They introduced into his nature the new elements
of precision and clearness, which served
to counterbalance the undefined sensations excited
by music.</p>

<p>Thus the boy’s day was filled; he could not
complain of the lack of new impressions.
He seemed to be living as full a life as
any child could possibly live; in fact he
really seemed unconscious of his blindness.
Nevertheless, a certain premature sadness was
still perceptible in his character, which Maxim
ascribed to the fact that he had never mingled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
with other children, and endeavored to atone
for this omission.</p>

<p>The village boys who were invited to the
mansion were timid and constrained. Not only
the unusual surroundings, but the blindness of
the little Pan intimidated them. They would
glance timidly at him, and then crowding together
would whisper to one another. When
the children were left alone, either in the
garden or in the field, they grew bolder and
began to play games; but somehow it always
ended in the blind boy being left out, listening
sadly to the merry shouts of his playmates. Now
and then Joachim would gather the children
about him and repeat comical old proverbs and
tell them fairy tales. The village children, perfectly
familiar with the somewhat stupid Hohòl
devil and the roguish witches, supplemented
Joachim’s tales from the stores of their own
knowledge; and the conversations ensuing were
generally quite lively. The blind boy listened
to them with great interest and attention, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
rarely laughed. He seemed incapable of comprehending
the humor in the speeches and
stories he heard; and this was not surprising,
since he could neither see the merry twinkle
in the eyes of the speakers, nor the comical
wrinkles, nor the twitching of the long
mustaches.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Not long before the period to which our story
relates, the “possessor”<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> of the neighboring
estate had been changed. The former neighbor,
who had managed to engage in a lawsuit
even with the taciturn Pan Popèlski, in consequence
of some damage caused to the fields,
had been replaced by the old man Yaskùlski and
his wife. Although the united ages of this
couple amounted to one hundred years, their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
marriage had been celebrated but recently,
because Yakùb was for a long time unable to
procure the sum required for hiring an estate,
and thus was forced to act as overseer of one
estate after another, while Pani Agnyèshka spent
her period of waiting as a sort of companion in
the family of the Countess N. When at last
the happy moment arrived, and the bride and
bridegroom stood hand in hand in the church,
the hair of the handsome bridegroom was fairly
gray, and the timid, blushing face of the bride
was likewise framed in silvery locks.</p>

<p>This circumstance, however, by no means
marred the married happiness of the somewhat
late-wedded pair, and the fruit of their love was
an only daughter about the age of the blind boy.
Having won for themselves a domestic shelter,
where under certain conditions they had a right
to full control, this elderly couple began a
peaceful and quiet existence, which seemed like
a compensation for the hard years of toil and
anxiety which they had passed in other folks’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
houses. Their first lease was a failure, and they
had started anew on a somewhat smaller scale.
But in this new abode they had at once arranged
things to suit themselves. In the corner
occupied by the images, decorated with ivy,
sacred palm, and a wax taper,<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> the old lady
kept bags filled with herbs and roots, by whose
aid she doctored her husband as well as the
peasants who came to consult her. These herbs
would fill the hut with a peculiarly characteristic
fragrance, associated in the minds of the villagers
with their memory of that neat and quiet
little house, with the two old persons who dwelt
therein, and whose placid existence offered so
unusual a spectacle in times like these.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the only daughter of this elderly
pair was growing up in their companionship,—a
girl with long brown tresses and blue eyes,
who straightway impressed every one that saw
her with the uncommon maturity of her face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
It seemed as if the calm love of the parents,
finding fruition so late in life, had been reflected
in their daughter’s nature by a mature judgment,
a quiet deliberation in all her movements,
and a certain pensive expression in the depths
of her blue eyes. She was never shy with
strangers, willingly made the acquaintance of
children and took part in their games,—which
was done however with an air of condescension,
as if she herself really felt no interest in
the matter. She was in fact quite happy in her
own society, walking, gathering flowers, talking
to her doll,—and all so demurely that one felt
as if in the presence of a grown-up woman
rather than in that of a child.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>One evening Petrùsya was sitting alone on
the hillock above the river. The sun was
setting, the air was still, and only the tranquil, far-away
sound of the lowing herds returning to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
village reached his ear. The boy had but just
ceased playing and had thrown himself on the
grass, yielding to the half dreamy languor of a
summer evening. He had been dozing for a
minute, when he was roused by a light footstep.
With a look of annoyance he rose on his elbow,
and listened. At the foot of the hill the unfamiliar
steps paused. He did not recognize
them.</p>

<p>“Boy!” he heard a child’s voice exclaim,
“do you know who it was that was playing
here just now?”</p>

<p>The blind boy disliked to have his solitude
disturbed. Therefore his answer to the question
was given in no amiable tone,—“It
was I.”</p>

<p>A slight exclamation of surprise greeted this
statement; and directly the girl’s voice added
with the utmost simplicity and in tones of
approval,—“How well you play!”</p>

<p>The blind boy made no reply. “Why don’t
you go away?” he asked presently, when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
perceived that his unwelcome visitor had not
left the spot.</p>

<p>“Why do you drive me away?” asked the
girl, and her clear tones expressed genuine
surprise.</p>

<p>The tranquil sound of the child’s voice was
grateful to the blind boy’s ear; nevertheless he
answered in his former tone,—“I don’t like to
have people come here.”</p>

<p>The girl burst into a peal of laughter.
“Really? What a strange idea! Is this all
your land, and have you the right to forbid
other people to walk upon it?”</p>

<p>“Mamma has given orders that no one shall
come here.”</p>

<p>“Your mamma?” asked the girl, thoughtfully;
“but my mamma allowed me to walk
over the river.”</p>

<p>The boy, somewhat spoiled by the universal
submission to his wishes, was not used to such
persistency. An angry flush swept like a wave
over his face, and half rising he exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
rapidly and excitedly,—“Go away! go away!
go away!”</p>

<p>It is impossible to tell how this scene would
have ended, for just then Joachim’s voice
sounded from the direction of the mansion,
calling the boy to tea, and he ran quickly
down the hill.</p>

<p>“Ah, what a hateful boy!” was the indignant
exclamation he heard follow him.</p>

<p>The next day while he was sitting on the
very same spot, yesterday’s adventure came to
his mind. Now, this memory excited no vexation;
on the contrary, he wished that the girl
with the quiet, tranquil voice, such as he had
never heard before, would come back again.
All the children that he knew shouted, laughed,
fought, and cried noisily; not one had such a
pleasant voice. He felt sorry to have offended
the stranger, who probably would never return.</p>

<p>The girl indeed did not return for three whole
days. But on the fourth day Petrùsya heard
her steps below on the river’s bank. She was
walking slowly, humming something to herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
in a low voice, and apparently paying no
attention to him.</p>

<p>“Wait a moment!” he called out, when he
perceived that she was going past; “is that
you again?”</p>

<p>The girl at first made no reply, for her feelings
had been hurt by her former reception;
but suddenly it seemed to occur to her that
there was something strange in the boy’s question,
and she paused. “Can’t you see that it
is I?” she asked with much dignity, as she
went on arranging a nosegay of wild flowers
which she held in her hand.</p>

<p>This simple question sent a thrill of pain
through the heart of the blind boy. He threw
himself back on the grass and made no reply.</p>

<p>But the conversation had been started, and
the girl still standing on the same spot and
busying herself with her flowers, asked again:
“Who taught you to play so well on the pipe?”</p>

<p>“Joachim taught me,” replied Petrùsya.</p>

<p>“You do play very well. Only why are you
so cross?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>“I—am not cross with you,” replied the
boy gently.</p>

<p>“Well, then, neither am I. Let us play
together.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how to play with you,” he
replied, hanging his head.</p>

<p>“Don’t know how to play? Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because.”</p>

<p>“Tell me why.”</p>

<p>“Because,” he replied scarce audibly, and
dropped his head still lower. Never before
had he been obliged to speak of his blindness,
and the innocent tone of the voice of the girl,
who asked this question with such artless persistency,
produced a painful impression upon
him.</p>

<p>“How odd you are!” she said with compassionate
condescension, seating herself beside
him on the grass. “It must be because you
are not acquainted with me. When you know
me better, you will no longer be afraid of me.
Now, <em>I</em> am not afraid of anybody.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>She said this with careless simplicity, as she
played with her corn-flowers and violets. Meanwhile
the blind boy had accepted her challenge
to more intimate acquaintance, and as he knew
but one way of learning to know a person’s
face, he naturally had recourse to his usual
method. Grasping the girl’s shoulder with one
hand he began with the other to feel of her
hair and her eye-lashes; he passed his fingers
swiftly over her face, pausing occasionally to
study the unfamiliar features with deep attention.
All this was so unexpected, and done
with such rapidity, that the girl in her utter
amazement never opened her lips; she only
looked at him with wide-open eyes in which
could be seen a feeling akin to horror. Not
until now had she noticed anything unusual in
the face of her new acquaintance. The pale
and delicately cut features of the boy were
rigid with a look of constrained attention, which
seemed in some way incongruous with his fixed
gaze. His eyes looked straight ahead, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
any apparent relation to what he was doing,
and in them shone a strange reflection from the
setting sun. For a moment the girl felt as if it
were some dreadful nightmare.</p>

<p>Releasing her shoulder from the boy’s hand,
she suddenly sprang to her feet and burst into
a flood of tears. “What are you doing to me,
you naughty boy?” she exclaimed angrily
through her tears. “Why do you touch me?
What have I done to you? Why?”</p>

<p>Confused as he was, he remained sitting on
the same spot with drooping head, while a
strange feeling of mingled anger and vexation
filled his heart with burning pain. Now for the
first time he felt the degradation of a cripple;
for the first time he learned that his physical
defect might inspire alarm as well as pity.
Although he had no power to formulate the
sense of heaviness that oppressed him, he suffered
none the less because this feeling was
dim and confused. A sense of burning pain
and bitter resentment swelled the boy’s throat;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
he threw himself down on the grass and wept.
As the weeping increased, convulsive sobs shook
his little frame,—the more violently, because
his innate pride made him struggle to repress
this outburst.</p>

<p>The girl, who had scarcely reached the foot
of the hill, hearing those stifled sobs turned in
amazement. When she saw that odd new acquaintance
of hers lying face downward on the
ground, crying so bitterly, she felt a sympathy
for him, and climbing the hill again she stood
over the weeping boy.</p>

<p>“What is it?” she said. “Why are you crying?
Perhaps you think that I shall complain?
Don’t cry! I shall not say a word to any
one.”</p>

<p>These words of sympathy and the caressing
voice excited a still more violent fit of sobbing.
Then the girl sitting down beside the boy,
devoted herself to the task of comforting
him.</p>

<p>Passing her hand gently over his hair, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
an instinct purely feminine, and a gentle persistency,
she raised his head and wiped the tears
from his eyes, like a mother who tries to comfort
her grieving child.</p>

<p>“There, there, I am no longer vexed,” she
said in the soothing tone of a grown-up woman.
“I see you are sorry to have frightened
me.”</p>

<p>“I did not mean to frighten you,” he replied,
drawing a long breath in his efforts to repress
his nervous sobs.</p>

<p>“Well, it is all right now. I am no longer
angry. You will never do it again,” she added,
raising him from the ground and trying to make
him sit down beside her.</p>

<p>Petrùsya yielded. Again he sat facing the
sunset, and when the girl saw his face lighted
by the crimson rays, she was impressed by its
unusual expression. The tears were still standing
in the boy’s eyes, which were as before
immovable, while his features were twitching
convulsively with childlike sobs,—all the signs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
of a deep sorrow, such as a mature nature might
feel, were evident.</p>

<p>“How queer you are—really!” she said with
thoughtful sympathy.</p>

<p>“I am not queer,” replied the boy with a
pitiful look. “No, I am not queer! I am—blind!”</p>

<p>“Bli—nd?” she repeated, prolonging the
word in her surprise, while her voice trembled,
as though that sad word, softly uttered by the
boy, had given a heavy blow to her womanly
little heart. “Blind?” she repeated again;
her voice trembled still more, and then as
though seeking a refuge from the uncontrollable
sense of misery that had come over her, she
suddenly threw her arms around the boy’s neck
and hid her face on his breast.</p>

<p>This sad discovery taking her entirely by
surprise, had instantly changed the self-composed
little woman to a grieved and helpless
child, who in her turn wept bitterly and inconsolably.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>Meanwhile the sun, revolving as it were in the
glowing atmosphere, vanished below the dark
line of the horizon. For a moment the golden
rim of the fiery ball had lingered on the edge,
leaving two or three burning sparks behind,
and then the dark outlines of the distant forest
became at once defined by an uninterrupted
blue line. The wind blew fresh from the
river.</p>

<p>The girl had ceased crying; only now and
then a sob would break forth in spite of her.
Petrùsya sat with bowed head as if hardly able
to comprehend so lively an expression of sympathy.</p>

<p>“I am—sorry,” she said at last, by way of
explaining her weakness, but her voice was still
broken by sobs. Then after a short silence,
having partially regained her self-control, she
made an attempt to change the conversation to
some topic of which they could both speak with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
composure. “The sun has set,” she said
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how it looks,” was the mournful
reply. “I only—feel it.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know the sun?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“And you don’t know your mamma, either?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know mamma. I can tell her step
from a distance.”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course you can. I can tell my
mother when my eyes are shut.”</p>

<p>The conversation had assumed a less agitating
tone.</p>

<p>“I can feel the sun,” said the blind boy,
growing more animated, “and I can tell when
it has set.”</p>

<p>“How can you tell?”</p>

<p>“Because—don’t you see?—I can’t tell
why myself.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the girl, and she seemed quite
satisfied with this reply, and both were silent.</p>

<p>“I can read,” Petrùsya was the first to break<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the silence, “and I shall soon begin to learn to
write with a pen.”</p>

<p>“How do you manage?” she inquired, and
suddenly paused abashed, reluctant to pursue
the delicate subject.</p>

<p>But he understood her. “I read from my
own book, with my fingers,” he explained.</p>

<p>“With your fingers? I could never learn to
read with my fingers. I read poorly enough
with my eyes. My father says that it is difficult
for women to learn.”</p>

<p>“And I can even read French.”</p>

<p>“How clever you are!” she exclaimed
admiringly. “But I am afraid that you will
take cold,” she added; “see how the fog is rising
over the river.”</p>

<p>“And you yourself?”</p>

<p>“I am not afraid. What harm can it do
me?”</p>

<p>“Neither am I afraid. Could a man possibly
take cold more easily than a woman?
Uncle Maxim says a man must never fear anything,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
neither cold nor hunger, nor the thunderbolt,
nor the hurricane.”</p>

<p>“Maxim,—the one on crutches? I have
seen him. He is terrible.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed. He is very kind.”</p>

<p>“No, he is terrible,” she persisted. “You
cannot know, because you never saw him.”</p>

<p>“I do know him. He teaches me everything.”</p>

<p>“Does he beat you?”</p>

<p>“Never. He never beats me or screams at
me,—never.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am glad of that. How could anybody
strike a blind boy? It would be a sin.”</p>

<p>“He never strikes any one,” said Petrùsya,
in an abstracted tone of voice, for his sensitive
ear had caught the sound of Joachim’s steps.</p>

<p>In fact the tall figure of the Hohòl appeared
a moment later on the summit of the rising
ground that separated the estate from the shore,
and his voice resounded through the tranquil
evening air,—“Panitch!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>“They are calling you,” said the girl, rising.</p>

<p>“I know it; but I don’t want to go.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, do go. I will come to see you
to-morrow. They are waiting for you now, and
for me too.”</p>

<p>The girl was faithful to her promise, and appeared
even earlier than Petrùsya could have
expected her. The next day as he was sitting
in his room at his daily lesson with Maxim, he
suddenly raised his head, listened, and exclaimed
eagerly, “May I go for a minute?
The girl has come.”</p>

<p>“What girl do you mean?” inquired Maxim,
as he followed the boy out of the door.</p>

<p>Petrùsya’s acquaintance of yesterday had in
fact entered the yard of the mansion at that
very moment, and on seeing Anna Michàilovna
who was in the act of crossing it, deliberately
went up to her.</p>

<p>“What do you wish, dear child?” asked the
former, supposing that she had been sent on
some errand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>The little woman offered her hand, as she
demurely inquired, “Are you the mother of the
blind boy? Yes?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear,” replied Pani Popèlska, admiring
the girl’s clear eyes and the ease of her
manners.</p>

<p>“Well, Mamma gave me permission to come
to see him. May I see him?”</p>

<p>At that moment Petrùsya himself ran up to
her, and behind him in the vestibule appeared
Maxim.</p>

<p>“That’s yesterday’s girl, Mamma,—the one
I told you of,” exclaimed the boy, as he greeted
the child. “But I am taking my lesson now.”</p>

<p>“Well, Uncle Maxim will excuse you this
time,” said Anna Michàilovna. “I will ask
him.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the little woman, perfectly at
home, approached Maxim, who was advancing
toward her with his crutch and cane, and extending
her hand, remarked with the most
gracious condescension, “It is very good of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
you not to strike a blind boy. He has told me
of it.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, my young lady!” exclaimed
Maxim, with a comical affectation of gravity,
clasping between his own broad palms the girl’s
tiny hand. “How grateful I ought to be to my
pupil that he won your good-will in my behalf!”
And Maxim laughed, as he patted the
hand he retained in his own. Meanwhile the
girl stood looking at him with her clear, open
gaze, which completely subjugated his woman-hating
heart.</p>

<p>“Well, Annùsya,” said Maxim to his sister
with a quizzical smile, “it seems that our Peter
is beginning to choose his own friends. And
you cannot deny, Annya, that he has made a
good choice, even though he is blind. Has he
not?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Max?” asked the
young woman, gravely, as the color mounted to
her cheeks.</p>

<p>“I was only joking,” replied the brother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
briefly, perceiving that his sally had touched a
sensitive chord, which responding revealed a
hidden thought in the maternal heart.</p>

<p>Anna Michàilovna blushed still more deeply;
she stooped hastily, and with a sudden passionate
tenderness embraced the girl, who received
this unexpected and impulsive caress with her
usual serene though slightly surprised expression.</p>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>From that day the closest intimacy was established
between the Popèlski mansion and the
home of the Possessor. The girl, whose name
was Evelyn, came every day to the mansion,
and in a short time she too became Uncle
Maxim’s pupil.</p>

<p>At first this plan of companionship in study
did not meet with Pan Yaskùlski’s approval.
In the first place he thought that a woman
needed no more education than would enable
her to keep a memorandum of the soiled linen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
and an account of her own expenses; in the
second place he was a good Catholic, and believed
that Maxim had committed a sin in
fighting the Austrians in defiance of the clearly
expressed admonition of the “father-pope.”
Finally he firmly believed that there was a God
in heaven, and that Voltaire and his followers
were plunged in fiery pitch,—a fate which also,
as many believed, was in waiting for Pan Maxim.
However, as he grew to know him more intimately,
he was obliged to admit that this
heretic and fighter was a very good-natured and
clever man, and so the Possessor compromised
the matter.</p>

<p>“Let me tell you this, Vèlya,” he said, addressing
his daughter, as he was on the point
of leaving her to take her first lesson from
Maxim, “never forget that there is a God in
heaven and a Holy Father in Rome. I, Valentine
Yaskùlski, say this to you; and you must
believe me, because I am your father. That
for <i lang="it">primo</i>. <i lang="it">Secundo</i>, I am a Polish nobleman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
and on my coat-of-arms, together with the hay-rick
and the crow, is a cross on an azure field.
The Yaskùlskis were ever good knights, and at
the same time they were not ignorant concerning
religious matters; and for that reason also
you must believe me. But in regard to all subjects
relating to <i lang="la">orbis terrarum</i> you are to respect
what Pan Maxim Yatzènko tells you, and
study faithfully.”</p>

<p>“Do not fear, Pan Valentine,” retorted Maxim,
smiling, “we do not draft little Panis into
Garibaldi’s regiment.”</p>

<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>Both children profited by this companionship
in study. Although Petrùsya was farther advanced,
there was still an opportunity for competition.
Moreover, he could often help his
new friend about her lessons, and she was very
successful in devising methods of explanation in
regard to subjects which were naturally difficult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
for a blind boy to comprehend. Her society
had introduced a new element into his studies,
contributing a pleasing excitement to his mental
labors.</p>

<p>Taking it all in all, fate had certainly proved
propitious in this gift of friendship. The boy
no longer sought solitude; he had found that
congenial companionship which the love of
older people had not afforded, and in moments
when his little soul was most peaceful he was
glad to have his friend near him. They always
went together to the cliff or to the river-bank.
When he played, she listened with genuine delight;
and after he had laid his pipe aside,
she would describe in her vivid childlike way
the various objects in Nature that surrounded
them. She could not of course picture them
with absolute fidelity, but from her simple description
the boy gained a very clear idea of the
characteristic coloring of every phenomenon
which she described. Thus, for instance, when
she spoke of the darkness with which the black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and misty night shrouded the earth, he formed
a conception of this same darkness from the
low tones of her timid voice. Then again, as
she raised her serious face and said to him,
“Ah, what a cloud is coming toward us!—a
very dark cloud!” he seemed directly to feel
its cold blast, and in her voice he fancied the
rustling sound of the creeping monster advancing
threateningly upon him far above his head.</p>

<p>There are natures that seem
predestined for the gentle task of love, as well
as for the anxieties of sorrow,—natures in
whom a sympathy for the cares or griefs of
others is a necessity as imperative as the air they
breathe. They have been endowed with that
calmness so essential for the fulfilment of every-day
duties; all the natural longings for personal
happiness seem to have been restrained and
held in subserviency to the ruling characteristic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
of their temperaments. Such beings often appear
too placid, too reasonable, and devoid of
sentiment. They are insensible to the passionate
longings of a life of pleasure, and follow
the stern path of duty with as much contentment
as if it were yielding them the most glowing
joys. They seem as frigid and majestic as
the mountain-tops. Commonplace human life
abases itself at their feet; even gossip and calumny
glide from their snowy white garments
like spatters of mud from the wings of a swan.</p>

<p>Peter’s little friend presented all the traits of
this type, which as the product of education
or experience is but rarely seen. Like genius,
it falls to the lot of the chosen few, and generally
manifests itself early in life. The mother
of the blind boy realized what good fortune
had befallen her son in winning the friendship
of this child. Old Maxim likewise appreciated
this, and felt confident that since his pupil now
enjoyed the benefit of an influence heretofore
wanting, his moral development would make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
tranquil and continuous progress. But this
proved a sad mistake.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>During the first few years of the child’s life
Maxim had believed the boy’s mental growth
to be under his entire control, and its processes,
if not directly guided by his influence, at
least so far affected by it that no new intellectual
manifestation or acquisition could evade
his vigilance. But when the boy reached that
period of his life which forms the boundary between
childhood and youth, Maxim realized
how vain had been his audacious dreams of
education. Nearly every week revealed something
new, oftentimes something he had never
anticipated; and in his efforts to discover the
sources of the new idea, or representation
thereof, Maxim was invariably baffled. A certain
unknown influence, either organic growth
or hereditary development, was evidently participating
in Maxim’s educational plans; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
he often paused reverently to contemplate the
mysterious operations of Nature. In these outbreaks
by which Nature effects her gratuitous
revelations, disturbing, so to speak, the equilibrium
between the supply of acquired knowledge
on the one hand and that of personal
experience on the other, Maxim had no trouble
in following the connecting links of the phenomena
of universal life, which diverging into
thousands of channels enter into separate and
“individual” lives.</p>

<p>This discovery was at first startling to Maxim,
inasmuch as it revealed the fact that the mental
growth of the child was subject to other influences
beside his own. He became anxious for
the fate of his ward, alarmed at the possibility
of influences which could bring the blind man
nothing but irremediable suffering. Then he
tried to trace to their sources those mysterious
springs which had leaped to the surface, hoping
to obstruct their passage and check their
influence over the blind child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>Nor had the mother failed to observe these
things. One morning Pètrik ran up to her in
an unusual state of excitement.</p>

<p>“Mamma, Mamma,” he exclaimed, “I saw
a dream!”</p>

<p>“What did you see, my boy?” she asked;
and in her voice there was a pathetic intonation
as of doubt.</p>

<p>“I dreamed that I saw you and Uncle
Maxim; and—”</p>

<p>“What else?”</p>

<p>“I don’t remember.”</p>

<p>“And do you remember me?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied the boy, thoughtfully, “I have
forgotten everything.”</p>

<p>This was repeated several times; and each
time the boy grew sadder and more restless.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Once, as he was crossing the yard, Maxim
heard from the drawing-room, where the music-lessons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
usually took place, some very queer
exercises. They consisted of two notes. First,
the highest key of the upper register was struck
incessantly, in swift repetition; then the low
reverberation of a bass note jarred upon the
ear. Curious to discover what might be the
meaning of these strange musical exercises,
Maxim hobbled across the yard, and a minute
later entered the drawing-room. He paused,
and stood motionless in the doorway, contemplating
the scene before him.</p>

<p>The boy, who was now ten years old, sat on
a low stool at his mother’s feet. Beside him,
craning his neck and turning his long beak
from side to side, stood a tame stork which
Joachim had presented to the “Panitch.” The
boy fed him every morning from his own hands,
and the bird followed his new friend and master
from morning till night. At this moment
Petrùsya was holding him by one hand, and
slowly stroking his neck and back with the
other, while an expression of deep thought and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
absorption rested on his face. The mother
meanwhile, evidently excited and at the same
time with a look of sadness, was striking with
her finger the key that sent forth that sharp
resonant note. At the same time, slightly
bending forward from her seat, she watched the
boy’s face with a painful scrutiny. When his
hand, gliding along the brilliant white plumage,
reached the tips of the wings, where the white
plumes were suddenly replaced by black ones,
Anna Michàilovna instantly moved her hand
to the other key, and the low bass note, with
its deep reverberations, echoed through the
room.</p>

<p>Both mother and son were so much engrossed
in their occupation that they had not
observed Maxim’s entrance, until, recovering
from his astonishment, he interrupted this performance:
“Annùsya, what does this mean?”</p>

<p>Meeting Maxim’s searching glance, the young
woman was as much confused as if a severe
tutor had detected her in the commission of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
some fault. “You see,” she said in confusion,
“he tells me that he can distinguish a certain
difference between the colors of the stork, but
he cannot understand wherein this difference
consists. Truly he was the first one to mention
it, and I believe he is right.”</p>

<p>“Well, what of it?”</p>

<p>“Well, I was trying, after a fashion, to explain
this difference to him by sounds. Don’t
be vexed, Max, but I really think that there is
a correspondence.”</p>

<p>This unexpected idea took Maxim so entirely
by surprise that at first he was at a loss
for an answer. He asked her to repeat her
experiments, and as he watched the rigid concentration
of the boy’s expression he shook his
head. “Believe me, Anna,” he said when he
was alone with her, “it is better not to arouse
thoughts in the boy’s mind, to which you can
give no satisfactory solution. He must resign
himself to his blindness,—there is no help for
it; and it is our duty to keep him from trying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
to comprehend the light. For my part, I make
every effort to avert each question, and if it
were but possible to keep him removed from
all objects likely to suggest them, he would no
more realize that a sense is missing than we
who possess five deplore the want of a sixth.”</p>

<p>The sister yielded as usual to her brother’s
persuasive arguments; but this time both were
mistaken. While overrating the influence of
outside impressions, Maxim forgot the powerful
stimulus which Nature communicates to a
child’s soul.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>They had before them a blind child, a future
man, the possible father of a family. “Malevolent
fate,” or perhaps “accident” hidden
within the mysterious realm of phenomena,
had closed forever those eyes,—the windows
through which the soul receives impressions
from the glowing, many-colored, changing
world. Doomed never to behold the light of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the sun, although not himself the offspring of
the blind, he was still a link in the illimitable
chain of bygone lives, and contained within
himself the possibilities of future lives. All
those living links now lost in the remote past,
corresponding in proportion to their capacity
to the impressions of light, had transmitted to
him the inner faculty, and through him, blind
though he was, to an endless succession of
future generations who would possess the power
of vision.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Thus it was that in the depths of this child’s
soul these hereditary forces lay dormant,—vague
“possibilities,” hitherto unaffected by
outside influences. The whole fabric of his
mind, fashioned after the ancestral model, had
reserved within itself a substratum of the impressions
of light, the product of the countless
experiences of his ancestors. Thus in his inner
organization the blind man is like another possessing
eyesight, but with eyes forever closed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Hence a dim yet ever present consciousness of
desire that craves contentment; an undefined
yearning to exercise the dormant powers of his
soul which have never been called into action.
Hence also certain vague forebodings and endeavors,—like
the longing for flight, which
children feel, and the joys of which they taste
in witching dreams.</p>

<p>Now, at last, the instinctive inclination of
little Peter’s childish fancies was reflected on
his features in that look of troubled perplexity.
Those hereditary, and yet as far as he himself
was concerned undeveloped and therefore unshaped,
“possibilities” of the ideas of light
rose like obscure phantoms in the child’s mind,
exciting him to aimless and distressing efforts.
All his nature, in an unconscious protest against
the individual “accident,” rose to claim the
restoration of the universal law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>Consequently, however much Maxim might
try to exclude all outward impressions from his
nephew, he had no control over the urgent
cravings that came from within. With all
his precautions he could but avert a premature
awakening of these unsatisfied yearnings,
and thereby diminish the boy’s chances of
suffering. In every other respect the child’s
unhappy fate, with all its cruel consequences,
must take its course.</p>

<p>And like a dark shadow this fate advanced
to meet him. From year to year the boy’s
natural vivacity subsided, like a receding wave,
while the melancholy that was echoing within
his soul grew persistently, and left its impress
on his temperament. His laughter, which in
childhood resounded at every new and especially
vivid impression, was now rarely heard.
He was naturally less accessible to all that was
bright and cheerful, and more or less humorous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
than to that vague obscurity and gloom peculiar
to the Southern nature, which finds reflection
in the folk-songs. These made a deep impression
on the boy’s imagination. The tears
stood in his eyes whenever he heard how “the
grave whispers to the wind in the field,” and
he loved to wander through the fields himself,
listening to this murmur. He longed more
and more for solitude; and when in his hours
of recreation he started off on his lonely walk,
the family would avoid that direction, lest they
might disturb his solitude.</p>

<p>Seated upon some mound out on the steppe,
or on the hillock above the river, or on the
familiar cliff, Petrùsya would listen to the rustling
leaves, the whispering grass, the vague
soughing of the wind across the steppe. All
this harmonized perfectly with the deep seriousness
of his mood. There, so far as in him lay,
he was in absolute sympathy with Nature; he
understood her; she disturbed him by no perplexing
and unanswerable questions. There the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
wind fanned his very soul, and the grass seemed
to whisper soft words of pity; and as the spirit
of the youth in harmony with the gentle influences
that surrounded him melted at the tender
caress of Nature, he felt his bosom swell
with an emotion that communicated itself to
his whole being. In moments like these he
would throw himself on the cool, moist grass
and weep; but in these tears there was no
bitterness. Again, he would seize his pipe,
and enraptured by his own emotions would
improvise pensive melodies suited to his mood
and to the peaceful harmony of the steppe.
One could easily understand that any human
sound coming unexpectedly to interrupt this
mood would affect him like a distressing discord.
At such times the only fellowship
possible to him was with a soul akin to his
own; and in the fair-haired girl from the
estate of the Possessor the boy enjoyed just
such a companion.</p>

<p>This friendship was the more firmly knitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
by mutual sympathy. If Evelyn contributed to
their partnership her calmness, her gentle animation,
or imparted to the blind boy some new
detail of the surrounding life, he in turn gave
her his sorrow. The little woman’s knowledge
of him seemed to have dealt a serious blow to
her tender heart: pluck a dagger from a wound,
and the bleeding will increase. On the day
when she first learned to know the blind boy
on the hillock in the steppe, her sympathy for
his affliction had really caused her acute pain,
and his presence had grown by degrees quite
indispensable to her. Separation seemed to
renew and increase the poignant pain of her
wound, and she longed to be with her little
friend that she might appease her own suffering
by ministering constantly to his comfort.</p>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>One warm autumn night both families were
sitting on the terrace in front of the house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
admiring the starry sky, with its blue distances
and glimmering lights. The blind boy with his
friend sat as usual by his mother’s side. All
was still around the mansion, and for the moment
they sat silent; only the leaves stirred from
time to time, like startled things, with unintelligible
murmurings, and then lapsed into silence.</p>

<p>Suddenly a meteor, leaping forth from the
darkness, flashed across the sky in one brilliant
streak; and as it gradually disappeared, it left
behind a trail of phosphorescent light. Petrùsya
seated beside his mother had linked his arm in
hers, and she became suddenly conscious that
he started and began to tremble.</p>

<p>“What—was that?” he asked, with a look
of trouble on his face.</p>

<p>“It was a falling star, my child.”</p>

<p>“Ah yes, a star,” he said thoughtfully. “I
felt sure that it was a star.”</p>

<p>“How could you know, my boy?” inquired
the mother, with a pitiful accent of doubt in
her voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>“He is telling the truth,” exclaimed Evelyn;
“he knows many things like that.”</p>

<p>This increasing sensitiveness indicated that
the boy was evidently drawing near the critical
period that lay between childhood and youth.
Meanwhile his development pursued its quiet
course. He seemed to have grown accustomed
to his lot, and the exceptional and uniform
character of his sadness,—a sadness cheered
as it were by no single ray of light, but at the
same time free from all eager cravings, and
grown to be the habitual background of his
life,—was in some measure mitigated.</p>

<p>But this proved to have been simply a period
of temporary repose. Nature has appointed
these resting-places that the young organism
may gain strength to meet other attacks. During
these calms, new questions imperceptibly
rise to the surface and mature; and it needs
but a touch to disturb this outward peace, and
stir the soul to its very depths, even as the sea
is lashed by a sudden squall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>And thus a few more years
went by. There were no changes in the peaceful
mansion. The beech-trees in the garden
rustled as of old, only their foliage seemed to
have grown darker and thicker; the white
walls, although they had warped and settled
more or less, shone precisely as they used; the
thatched roofs frowned the same as ever; and
even the well-known sound of Joachim’s pipe
might be heard at the usual hour from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
direction of the stable. But Joachim himself,
still a bachelor, and grown gray in the service
as groom, chose rather to listen to the Panitch
when he played either the piano or the pipe, it
mattered not which. Maxim too, had grown
still more gray. The Popèlski had no other
children, and therefore their first-born, the blind
boy, remained as ever the central object of
interest, around which clustered the life of the
whole mansion. It was for his sake that the
family had thus isolated itself within its own
narrow circle, contented with its tranquil existence,
whose current had now united with the
equally placid life of the Possessor’s “cabin.”</p>

<p>Thus Peter, who had now become a youth,
had grown up like a hot-house plant, guarded
from the rude winds of the outer world. He
was still as of old in the centre of a vast, dark
world. Darkness enveloped him in every direction,—above,
around, on all sides; illimitable,
eternal. His delicate and sensitive organism
vibrated in response to every impression, like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
finely strung instrument. This sensitive expectancy
was perceptible in the blind youth’s
disposition; he seemed to feel that the darkness
was about to stretch forth its invisible arms
and arouse by its touch that which now lay
dormant in his breast, waiting only for the
summons. But the dreary darkness around
him, familiar from his childhood, replied only
by the caressing murmur that rose from the old
garden, inspiring him with vague, tranquillizing,
and dreamy thoughts. The turbulent current
of the far-off world, known to the blind boy
only through the medium of song and story,
had no entrance here. Amid the dreary
whispers of the garden and the peaceful every-day
life of the country house, he heard of the
tumults and tribulations of the world from the
lips of others; and his imagination pictured it
all veiled in clouds of mystery,—like a song,
an heroic poem, or a fairy tale.</p>

<p>Everything seemed favorable. The mother
felt that the soul of her son, protected as by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
wall was living in an enchanted dream, which
was tranquil even if it were unreal. Evelyn,
who had imperceptibly grown to womanhood,
watched this enchanted tranquillity with her
calm gaze, sometimes showing a slight surprise,
or an expression of wonder as to future events,
but never a shadow of impatience. Popèlski
the father had brought his estate into a prosperous
condition, but the good man troubled
himself very little about his son’s future life. A
man of Maxim’s temperament could only be ill
at ease in this quiet life; he simply endured it,
looking upon it as a temporary arrangement,
which had interwoven itself into his plans in
spite of himself. He deemed it necessary for
the youth’s interior nature to gain strength and
maturity, that he might be better able to cope
with the rude assaults of life.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, outside the limit of this enchanted
circle, life went on, seething, bubbling,
and raging; and at last the time came when
the old veteran decided to break into this circle,—to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
open the door of the hot-house, and
admit a current of outside air.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>By way of breaking the ice, he invited an
old friend, who lived about seventy versts from
the Popèlski estate, to pay him a visit. In former
times Maxim used to be the visitor; but
he knew that some young people were staying
at Stavruchènko’s house at that time, and so he
wrote him a letter inviting the whole party.
This invitation was accepted with pleasure.
The two old men were bound by ties of friendship,
and the young people were all familiar
with the once famous name of Maxim Yatzènko,
connected as it was with many a romantic tale.
One of the sons of Stavruchènko was a student
in the University of Kiev, in the School of Philology,
very popular at that time. Another son
was studying music in the St. Petersburg conservatory.
Another member of the party was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
young cadet, the son of a neighboring landlord.
Stavruchènko was a vigorous old man, gray-haired,
wearing a long mustache after the Cossack
fashion, and the loose Cossack trousers
tucked into the boots. His tobacco-pouch and
pipe were suspended from his belt, and he
spoke nothing but Little Russian; and beside
his two sons, dressed in white sleeveless coats
and embroidered Little Russian shirts, he vividly
recalled Gògol’s Taras Bulbà with his followers.
But Stavruchènko lacked the romantic
characteristics of Gògol’s hero. He was on the
contrary an excellent and practical landlord,
who had always got on well with the serfs; and
now that serfdom was abolished he was clever
enough to adapt himself to the new conditions.
He knew the people after the landlord fashion;
that is, he knew every peasant in his village, and
every peasant’s cow, and almost every extra
coin in each peasant’s purse.</p>

<p>But if Stavruchènko did not have hand-to-hand
encounters with his sons, like Bulbà,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
they were forever at odds, regardless of time
or place. Everywhere, whether at home or
abroad, endless disputes arose between the old
man and the young people; it usually began on
the part of the old man, who was always jeering
at the “ideal Panitchis.” The Panitchis
would grow excited, the old man likewise;
whereupon an indescribable uproar would ensue,
during which both sides would give and take
some pretty severe thrusts. It was a reproduction
of the differences between “Fathers” and
“Sons;” only in the southwest, where a certain
courtesy of manner prevails, such scenes in
the family circle are more gracefully managed.</p>

<p>The young people who had been away at
school from early childhood, had only seen the
country during their vacation, and therefore
had not the practical knowledge possessed by
the father-landlords. When that tidal wave
known as the “love of the people” came rushing
in upon society, it found the young men in
the higher classes of the Gymnasium. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
turned their attention to the study of the lower
classes, seeking their information at first in
books. They soon proceeded, however, to the
immediate study of the manifestations of the
“national spirit” in its causes. In the southwestern
districts the young Panitchis, in their
white <i lang="ru">svìtkas</i><a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and embroidered shirts, devoted
themselves to the fashionable amusement of
“visiting the people.” They paid but slight attention
to their economical condition, but made
notes of the words and music of the <i lang="ru">dùmkas</i><a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
and songs, studied the traditions, compared
historical events with the traces they had left
upon the popular mind, and looked upon the
peasant in general through the poetical prism
of an intellectually popular idealism. Thus the
constant clashing of opinions diametrically opposed
to one another entered into the disputes
between the old man and the young people,
and they were always at variance. And yet the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
old man himself listened with delight to the
eloquent tirades of the young fellows.</p>

<p>“Just hear him,” Stavruchènko would say to
Maxim, with a sly nudge of his elbow, while
the student with flushed face and sparkling
eyes was delivering his oration. “Hear him,
he talks like a book! One might really imagine
him a clever man. You had better tell us, you
wise-head, how my Nechipòr deceived you.”
The old man’s mustaches twitched, and he
laughed heartily as he related with a purely
Hohòl humor the tale of their discomfiture.</p>

<p>The young men blushed, but they paid him
back in his own coin, saying: “If they were
not familiar with the Nechipòrs and Hvèydkas
in certain villages, they had studied the class as
a whole; and from that point of view they deduced
their generalizations. For the aged and
experienced, whose habits of thought are fettered
by routine, the forest is hidden by the
trees that stand nearest, but young men can
embrace the most remote perspective at a
glance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>The old man was not displeased to hear the
learned discourses of his sons. “They did not
go to school for nothing,” he often remarked,
“but I can tell you that my Hvèydka will lead
you like calves by a rope. That’s the way it
is! But he cannot deceive me, for I can stuff
him into my tobacco-pouch and put him in my
pocket. You are nothing but youngsters and
fools!”</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>A discussion of this sort had but just ended.
The older people returned to the house, and
through the open windows one could from time
to time hear snatches of Stavruchènko’s funny
stories, together with the merry laughter of his
audience.</p>

<p>The young people remained in the garden.
The student spreading his <i lang="ru">svìtka</i> on the ground,
with his sheepskin hat pushed on one side, had
stretched himself out on the grass with affected
carelessness. His older brother sat beside
Evelyn on a bench near the wall. The cadet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
in his carefully buttoned uniform, was seated
next to them; while at a short distance, with
drooping head, sat the blind youth leaning
back against the window-sill. He was turning
over in his mind the discussions he had just
heard, which had stirred him deeply, even to
agitation.</p>

<p>“What did you think of all that was said
just now, Pani Evelyn?” said the student turning
to her; “you have not spoken a single
word.”</p>

<p>“What you told your father is all very fine;
but—”</p>

<p>“Well—but what?”</p>

<p>The young girl did not reply at once. She
let her work fall upon her lap, smoothed it out,
and slightly bending forward began to examine
it as if it absorbed her entire attention. It
would have been difficult to say whether she
was considering the advisability of using coarser
canvas for her embroidery, or whether she was
meditating over her reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile the young men waited impatiently.
The student, his face kindling with interest,
rose on his elbow and turned toward the
young girl. Her neighbor sat gazing at her with
his calm and questioning eyes. The blind young
man abandoned his easy attitude, sat up erect,
and turned his face away from the others.</p>

<p>“But,” she said softly, still smoothing out
her embroidery, “every man must choose his
own career, gentlemen.”</p>

<p>“Lord bless us; what wisdom!” rudely
exclaimed the student. “Really, how old are
you, Pani?”</p>

<p>“Seventeen,” replied Evelyn, simply,—straightway
adding, with an air of mingled
triumph and curiosity, “I suppose you thought
that I was a great deal older, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>The young men laughed.</p>

<p>“Had I been asked for an opinion concerning
your age,” said her neighbor, “I should
have been quite at a loss to decide between
thirteen and twenty-three. At times you seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
a mere child, and the next moment I hear you
reasoning with the wisdom of an aged dame.”</p>

<p>“You must treat serious matters seriously,
Gavrìlo Petròvitch,” said the young girl in
tones of admonition, and once more returned
to her work.</p>

<p>For a moment all were still. Evelyn resumed
her needle-work with her former deliberation,
while the young men looked with curiosity at
the miniature form of this wise young person.
Although she had grown and developed considerably
since the time of her first meeting
with Peter, the student’s comments upon her
age were quite just. At the first glance this
tiny, slender maiden seemed but a girl, although
her tranquil, self-possessed movements revealed
the dignity of a woman. Her face produced
the same impression. That type of face seems
peculiar to the Slav women. Handsome, regular
features, outlined in calm severity; blue
eyes, with a direct and tranquil gaze; pale
cheeks, rarely tinged with color,—not however
the pallor that is ever ready to flush with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
burning flame of passion, but rather akin to the
cold purity of the snow. Evelyn’s fair hair,
glossy and abundant, showing darker reflections
about her marble-like temples, was drawn back
and gathered into one massive braid, which
seemed to weigh her head back as she
walked.</p>

<p>The blind youth, too, had grown taller and
more mature. Any one seeing him at that
moment, as he sat apart from the group just
described, pale, agitated, and handsome, would
have been instantly attracted by that peculiar
face, upon whose surface every emotion of the
soul was so plainly reflected. His black hair
waved over a high forehead faintly lined by
premature wrinkles; his cheeks alternately
flushed and grew pale; the lower lip, slightly
drooping at the corners, twitched nervously
from time to time, and the large handsome
eyes with their unwavering gaze added to this
eminently South Russian type of face a somewhat
unusual and sombre character.</p>

<p>“So Pani Evelyn supposes,” said the student<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
in a sarcastic tone, after a short pause, “that
the matters we have been discussing here are
inaccessible to the feminine mind; that her
sphere is to be limited by the nursery and
the kitchen.”</p>

<p>The young girl replied with her usual seriousness:
“No, you are mistaken. I understood
all that was said,—therefore it is accessible to
a woman’s mind. I spoke only for myself,
individually.”</p>

<p>She became silent again, and bending over
her work seemed so absorbed in it that the
young man had not the courage to pursue his
questions.</p>

<p>“Strange,” he muttered; “one might suppose
that you had deliberately planned the
entire course of your life.”</p>

<p>“Why should that seem strange, Gavrìlo
Petròvitch?” replied the young girl gently.
“Probably even Illyà Ivànovitch [that was the
cadet’s name] has plans for the future, and he
is younger than I.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>“You are right,” remarked the cadet, flattered
by this supposition. “Not long ago I read the
biography of N——. He too had definite
plans for his life. He married at twenty, and
was a commander at twenty-five.”</p>

<p>The student laughed sarcastically, and the
young girl blushed.</p>

<p>“You see,” she said a moment later, in the
same quiet tone, “every one plans his own
career.”</p>

<p>No one replied, and a thoughtful silence fell
upon the young people,—a silence beneath
which a certain awkwardness was evident.
They were all aware that the conversation had
become personal; and the rustle of the darkening
and seemingly displeased old garden was
all the sound they heard.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>These conversations and discussions, this
buoyant current of youthful life charged with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
questions, hopes, expectations, and opinions,
came rushing like a passionate storm upon the
blind youth. At first he listened to them with
a look of surprise, but it was not long before he
found that the stream rushed along paying no
heed to him. No questions were asked him,
neither was he invited to give his opinion; and
it soon became evident to him that he stood
apart in a solitude, the sadder since brought
into contrast with the present wide-awake life
of the mansion. Nevertheless he listened to
all this that was so new to him, and his contracted
brow and pallid face bore witness to his
intense interest. Yet this feeling was tinged
with gloom; his brain was swarming with bitter
thoughts.</p>

<p>The mother looked sorrowfully at her son.
Evelyn’s eyes expressed sympathy and alarm.
Maxim alone did not seem to notice the impression
that this noisy company made upon his
nephew, and hospitably invited the guests to
come often, assuring the young men that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
would furnish them with abundant ethnographical
material on their next visit.</p>

<p>The guests departed, promising to come
again. The young men shook hands cordially
with Peter when they said good-by. He nervously
returned their pressure, and for a long
time listened to the sound of the brìtchka as it
rolled along the road. Then he turned suddenly
and went into the garden.</p>

<p>After the departure of the guests everything
at the manor lapsed into its former tranquillity;
but to the blind youth this silence seemed
strange, unusual, and peculiar. It implied an
acknowledgment that an important event had
taken place on the estate. The silent garden-paths
where he was wont to hear only the
whisper of the beech-trees and the lilacs, now
resounded in his fancy with the echoes of recent
conversations. From the open window of
the drawing-room he heard the voices of
his mother and Evelyn arguing with Maxim.
He was struck by the pathetic tone of entreaty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
in his mother’s voice, while that of Evelyn rang
out with indignation; Maxim meanwhile eagerly
but firmly resisted the entreaties of the two
women. Upon Peter’s approach, these discussions
instantly ceased.</p>

<p>Consciously, and with pitiless hand, Maxim
had made the first breach in the wall which till
now encompassed his nephew’s world. The
first noisy and tumultuous wave had already
made its way through this breach, and the
equilibrium of the young man’s soul was shaken
by its onslaught. Now he realized the limitations
of his magic circle; the quiet of the
estate seemed oppressive to him, the indolent
whisper and rustle of the old garden hung like
a weight upon the peaceful dream of his young
soul. Something wavered to and fro in the
darkness, pressing toward him with wistful and
enticing eagerness. It called and beckoned,
awakening the questions that had been slumbering
within him. The pallor of his face
and a dull indefinite sense of misery in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
soul were the visible signs that the summons
was heard. Maxim meanwhile was preparing
for a second breach.</p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>When in the course of two weeks the young
men accompanied by their father came to repeat
their visit, Evelyn received them with a
certain coolness. But she found it hard to
resist the charming animation of youth. All
day long the young men roamed about the
village, hunting and taking notes of the songs
of the reapers; and in the evening they assembled
as before around the bench, near the
mansion.</p>

<p>On one of these evenings, before Evelyn
realized the fact, the conversation had turned
to subjects of a somewhat personal character.
Neither could the others have told how this
had come about; it had been as imperceptible
as the fading of the evening twilight, or the
falling of the shadows in the garden,—as imperceptible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
as the first notes of the nightingale’s
song among the bushes. The young student
spoke passionately, with a proud air of triumph,
and with all that ardor peculiar to youth, which
regardless of selfish calculations rushes to meet
the unknown future. There was a strange fascination
in this ardent faith, and something also
akin to the indomitable power of a challenge.</p>

<p>The young girl blushed, for she felt that this
challenge was perhaps unconsciously directed
at her. She bent low over her work as she
listened. Her eyes sparkled, her face flushed,
her heart throbbed. The light faded from her
eyes, her face grew pale, she compressed her
lips; while her heart continued to beat still
more violently, and a look of alarm came over
her features. She was frightened, for under
the influence of this student’s words, the dark
garden wall seemed to part before her eyes,
and through the opening she saw the far-away
vista of a vast world full of life and activity.
She was startled. It seemed to her that some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
one was about to pluck the knife from out her
former wound.</p>

<p>This however was of short duration. Evelyn
could control her own life; of that she was
well aware. She had arrived at a decision in
regard to her future life, and this decision was
to be final; she had deliberated long concerning
her first step in life, and proposed to act
in accordance with her plan. This being accomplished,
she would try to make the most of
life. She turned her deep blue eyes from the
student and looked toward the spot where
Peter had been sitting. But he was no longer
there.</p>

<p>Then quietly folding her work Evelyn rose
also. “Excuse me, gentlemen,” she said, addressing
the guests, “if I leave you to yourselves
for a while.” And she started along the
garden-path.</p>

<p>Evelyn was not the only person who had
felt disturbed this evening. At the turn of the
path, where the settle had been placed, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
young girl heard the agitated voices of Maxim
and his sister.</p>

<p>“Yes, I thought of her in this connection no
less than I did of him,” the old man was saying;
and his tone was harsh. “I cannot believe
that you wish to take advantage of the
ignorance of a mere child.”</p>

<p>Tears were in the voice of Anna Michàilovna
as she replied, “But Max, what if—if she—What
will become of my boy?”</p>

<p>Maxim had no time to reply. The young
girl who had paused instinctively at the turning,
now quickly advanced, and with proudly erect
head walked past the speakers. Maxim involuntarily
drew up his crutch that it might not be
in her way, and Anna Michàilovna looked at
her with an expression of love, mingled with
adoration almost amounting to awe. The
mother seemed conscious that this fair proud
girl, who had just passed by with a look so
angry and defiant, held in her hands the happiness
or unhappiness of her son.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>A ruined and abandoned mill stood in the
garden. The wheels had ceased to turn, the cylinders
were overgrown with moss, and the water
trickled through the old locks in slender, never-ceasing
streams. This was the blind youth’s
favorite resort. Here he would spend hours
on the parapet of the dam, listening to the
sound of the trickling water, which he later
reproduced to perfection on the piano. But
now he was thinking of other things. Rapidly
he trod the path, his heart filled with bitterness,
and his face distorted by suffering. He paused
when he heard the young girl’s light step; accustomed
as he was to confide all his feelings
to her, he felt no embarrassment in her
presence.</p>

<p>Evelyn rested her hand on his shoulder as
she asked,—“What is it? Why are you so
sad?”</p>

<p>He did not reply at first, but turning, began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
once more to pace up and down the path.
The young girl walked beside him.</p>

<p>Thus a few minutes went by in silence. It
seemed as if the presence of Evelyn had a
tranquillizing influence upon Peter’s mood; the
keen pain diminished, his face grew more
peaceful; the flood of sadness that had overwhelmed
his soul began to subside, and a new
sense of mingled pleasure and expectancy had
taken possession of him. This feeling, to whose
healing influence he had often yielded, he had
never yet made an attempt to analyze. And
now again his mood grew tender, although a
shade of sadness still remained.</p>

<p>“Of course it made me feel sad,” he said,
after a moment’s silence; “because I understood
their words, although they were not
directed toward me. I am useless, quite useless
in the world. And why was I born
into it?”</p>

<p>The girl glanced up at him with a look of
alarm, and then as if with settled purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
she bent her head and resumed her walk by
his side.</p>

<p>The blind youth stopped short. “Why, I
ask, was I born into the world? And another
thing—It may perhaps be true, as old people
say, that affairs have changed for the worse;
yet in old times the blind fared better than
they do now. There was work for them, and
they had a place in life. Why was I not born
in times when blind minstrels used to wander
from place to place? I would then take my
lyre, or bandur,<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and go from city to city and
through the villages and distant steppes, and
wherever I appeared the people would gather
around me, while I sang to them of the deeds
of their fathers, glorious and heroic, stirring
their holiest feelings, and inspiring them with
energy and courage. Thus I too could play a
part in life. But now, even that cadet with
his shrill voice,—you heard what he said
about marrying and being a commander. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
laughed at him; but for me even that is
unattainable.”</p>

<p>Tears came into the young girl’s eyes, widening
with alarm. “You are excited by the
student’s talk.” She tried to speak lightly, but
her agitation betrayed itself in her voice.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Peter, thoughtfully; “and
what an agreeable fellow he is! He has a very
pleasing voice.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is agreeable,” said Evelyn, abstractedly;
and her tone evinced a certain tenderness.
Then as if vexed with herself she
suddenly exclaimed in a passionate voice:
“No, I don’t like him at all! He has too much
self-assurance; and I think his voice is harsh
and disagreeable.”</p>

<p>Peter listened in surprise to this angry sally.
The girl stamped her foot as she went on:</p>

<p>“And it is all the most perfect folly! I
know it has been a plan of Maxim’s contriving.
Oh, how it makes me hate him!”</p>

<p>“Why, Vèlya,” expostulated the blind youth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
“how can you blame Uncle Maxim for what has
happened?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he thinks himself extremely clever;
and he has destroyed every vestige of humanity
within his breast by all these plans and schemes.
Don’t speak to me of those people! I should
like to know how they gained the right to
arrange other people’s lives?” She stopped
abruptly, clenched her slender hands and burst
into a flood of childlike tears.</p>

<p>Peter took her hand and pressed it sympathetically.
He was taken by surprise. This
outburst from the usually calm and self-controlled
girl was both unexpected and mysterious.
As he listened to her weeping he was conscious
of a new and peculiar emotion stirring within
his breast.</p>

<p>Suddenly she gave him a fresh surprise by
withdrawing her hand and bursting into a fit of
laughter. “How silly I am! What in the
world am I crying about?” She wiped her
eyes and went on good-naturedly: “One must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
be just. They are both good, honest men, and
what he said was all very well! But it does not
apply to every one.”</p>

<p>“To every one who has the power,” replied
the blind youth, scarce audibly.</p>

<p>“What nonsense!” she answered brightly;
but in spite of her cheerfulness the traces of
recent tears could still be detected in her voice.
“Take Maxim for instance; he fought as long
as he was able, and now he lives as best he
may. And we also—”</p>

<p>“You say <em>we</em>? Why do you say that?” interrupted
Peter.</p>

<p>“Because—well—because sometime you
will marry me, and our lives will be one.”</p>

<p>Strangely confused and yet rejoicing, the
blind young man drew back a step. “I—marry
you? You mean—that you will—marry
me?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course, of course!” she replied
with mingled haste and agitation. “How dull
you must be! Can it be possible that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
have never thought of it? It seems so natural!
Whom could you marry if not me?”</p>

<p>“To be sure,” he assented in his inconsiderate
egotism. But instantly reflecting,—“Have
you forgotten, Vèlya,” he said, taking her by the
hand, “what these young men have just been
telling us about the education that girls receive
in the great cities? Consider what a career lies
open before you, while I—”</p>

<p>“Well, what about you?”</p>

<p>“I—am blind!” he ended in a somewhat
illogical conclusion.</p>

<p>The girl smiled, but continued in the same
tone: “What if you are blind? I love you even
so; hence it follows that I must marry you.
That is the way things happen; what can we
do about it?”</p>

<p>He also smiled, and dropped his head after
his usual pensive fashion, as though he were
listening to some voice within his soul. No
sound could be heard save the gentle rippling
of the water; and even that low murmur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
seemed at times to die away, but only to return
with greater force, and ripple on forever. The
leaves of the luxuriant wild cherry-tree whispered
to one another, and the last pensive trills
of the nightingale’s song echoed through the
garden.</p>

<p>By this bold, unexpected, and yet gentle
stroke the young girl had dispelled the lowering
cloud that darkened the blind youth’s heart.
Inspired by the new feeling that had taken possession
of his whole being, he fervently pressed
her little hand in his. A faint almost imperceptible
pressure was the response. Then he
clasped her round the waist and drew her
toward him, gently stroking her silken hair with
his other hand.</p>

<p>“Please, let me go, darling,” said the young
girl, in low, shy tones as she released herself
from his embrace.</p>

<p>Evelyn’s soft voice thrilled the blind youth’s
heart. He made no effort to detain her, but as
he yielded he heaved a profound sigh. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
heard her smoothing her hair. His heart
throbbed in deep but pleasing excitement, and
he could feel the hot blood surging with a force
hitherto unknown. And when a moment later
she said to him, “Come, let us go back to the
company,” he heard with delight and surprise
a new music in her charming voice.</p>

<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>The hosts were in the little drawing-room,
and all the guests had likewise assembled there;
the only missing members were Peter and
Evelyn. Maxim was conversing with his old
comrade, and the young men sat in silence
beside the open windows. One could not fail
to observe the strangely quiet yet expectant air
that brooded over this little circle, as if each
one had a premonition of an impending crisis.
Although Maxim never interrupted his conversation,
he kept all the while throwing swift, impatient
glances toward the door. Pani Popèlska<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
was trying to play the amiable and devoted
hostess, but her face bore a sad and almost
guilty look. Pan Popèlski alone, who had
grown a good deal stouter, but had lost none of
his amiability, sat quietly dozing in his chair,
waiting for supper.</p>

<p>All eyes turned in that direction when footsteps
were heard on the terrace which led from
the garden into the drawing-room. Within the
broad, dusky doorway appeared the figure of
Evelyn with the blind youth slowly mounting
the steps behind her. The young girl, although
conscious that every eye rested upon her, was
not in the least embarrassed. Crossing the
room with her usual composure, she smiled
slightly as she met the glance that Maxim
darted at her from beneath his brows, and her
own eyes flashed back defiance. Maxim grew
suddenly abstracted, and replied at random
when a question was directly addressed to him.
Pani Popèlska watched her son.</p>

<p>The young man followed the maiden, giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
no apparent heed to the direction in which she
was leading him. When his slender form and
pale face appeared against the background of
the doorway, he seemed to pause on the threshold
of that room so brightly lighted and filled
with guests; but after a moment’s hesitation he
crossed it with the air of one both absent-minded
and intensely absorbed, went up to the
piano, and opened it.</p>

<p>For the moment Peter seemed utterly unconscious
of his surroundings, forgetful of the presence
of strangers, and instinctively longing for
his favorite instrument as a vent whereby to
express the emotions that were filling his bosom.
Having raised the piano-lid, with his fingers
resting lightly on the keys he struck a few rapid
chords. It was as if he were putting a question,
half to the instrument and half to his own soul.
Then with his hands still resting on the keys,
he remained plunged in deep thought, while
utter silence reigned in the little drawing-room.
The night looked in through the dusky windows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
and here and there clusters of green leaves
shining in the lamplight peered curiously in
from the garden. The guests, their attention
aroused by these few whispering chords, and
influenced more or less by the strange inspiration
that seemed to radiate from the face of
the blind youth, sat in silent expectation.</p>

<p>But Peter remained as before, his eyes uplifted
as if he were listening. Mingled emotions
chased one another like billows through his
heart. He had been uplifted by the tide of a
new life,—even as a boat, after a long and
peaceful rest upon the sandy shore, is suddenly
tossed upward by the waves. Question, surprise,
and unwonted excitement filled his mind. The
blind eyes dilating, alternately sparkled and
grew dim. For a moment one might imagine
that he had not found within his soul the response
for which he so eagerly listened; but all
at once, with the same eager face, as though he
could no longer wait, he started, touched the
keys, and upborne by new waves of emotion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
surrendered himself to the tide that swept onward
in full, resonant, and tumultuous chords.
They gave voice to the countless memories of
his past life which had thronged upon him, as
with drooping head he sat there listening. The
multitudinous voices of Nature, the moaning of
the wind, the whispering of the forest, the
ripple of the river, and that indefinite murmur
which is lost in the remote distance could be
heard, intermingling, forming a sort of background
for the deep and inscrutable agitation
that swells the heart and leaps up in the soul
at the bidding of Nature’s mysterious whisper,—a
feeling not easily defined. Sadness?—why
then is it so sweet? Joy?—then why is
it so profoundly, so inexplicably sad?</p>

<p>All this was evoked by the blind musician’s
fingers, in low soft tones, at first hesitating and
vague. His imagination strove as it were to
gain control over this flood of chaotic images,
and without success. Those powerful and depressing
influences of an impetuous and passionate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
nature, confused and vague though they
were, had taken full possession of the musician,
but were as yet wholly beyond his control.
From time to time the sounds grew in volume
and power. One felt that the player must presently
combine them into a melodious and perfect
flood of harmony, and his audience listened
in breathless expectation, Maxim wondering all
the while as to the cause of the unusual depth
of feeling displayed. But before the flood had
time to rise to its full height, it suddenly subsided
into a plaintive murmur, like a wave
breaking into foam and spray; and again nothing
was heard but the sad lingering notes, that
rang like questions in the air.</p>

<p>The blind man paused for a moment, but
the silence in the drawing-room remained uninterrupted,
save by the rustling noise of the
leaves in the garden. The fascination which
had transported his listeners far beyond these
walls suddenly vanished, and until the musician
again struck the keys of the instrument they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
realized that they were seated in a small room,
with the dark night peering in at the windows.
Again the sounds rose and fell as if vainly seeking
after the unknown. Charming folk-songs
were interwoven with the vague harmony of the
chords,—songs telling of love and sorrow, or
reminiscences of the glories and sufferings of
bygone days, or the eager impetuosity of youth
and hope,—the blind man thus striving to
express his feelings by embodying them in
forms already familiar to his imagination. But
the song too ended with the same minor note,—like
an unanswered question echoing through
the silence of the little drawing-room.</p>

<p>Then for the third time Peter began to play
a piece which he had once learned by heart,—and
again broke off.</p>

<p>Possibly he had hoped to find the musical
genius of the composer in sympathy with his
mood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>It is a very difficult matter for a blind man
to play by note. These are printed in relief
like the letters which they use; each note has
its special sign, and stands in a row like the
lines of a book. To designate the notes that
form the chords, raised points are placed between
them. It is of course a difficult and
complicated task for a blind person to learn
these by heart, each hand separately; but in
Peter’s case the labor was lightened by his love
for the integral parts of the work. Memorizing
a few chords for one hand at a time, he would
place himself at the piano; and when, from the
combining of these hieroglyphics in relief, all of
a sudden surprising harmonies resulted, it gave
him a delight keen enough to enliven the otherwise
dull work, and render it fascinating.</p>

<p>Yet even so, there still remained a weary
way between the printed sheets of music and
the execution of the same; for in order that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the signs might be embodied in melody, the
hands had first to transmit them to the memory,
and the memory in its turn to send them back
to the fingers. Meanwhile, however, Peter’s
strongly developed musical instinct and imagination,
that had already taken a definite form,
began to play a part in the complicated labor
of memorizing, and to stamp the work of the
composer with the distinct impress of the
player’s own individuality. Thus far the form
which his musical feeling had taken, was for
the most part derived from his mother’s playing.
All Nature spoke to his soul in the language
and music of the folk-songs of his native
land.</p>

<p>While with beating heart and soul overflowing
with emotion, Peter now played this piece, from
the very first resonant chords there was such
brilliancy, animation, and genuine feeling, and
at the same time something so characteristic of
the player, that an expression of wonder was
mingled with delight on the faces of the listeners.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
The next moment, however, the wonder
was wholly merged in delight; and the elder
Stavruchènko’s son, a professional musician, as
he listened, strove for a long time to follow the
familiar piece, and at the same time to analyze
the peculiar “style” of the pianist.</p>

<p>Music recognizes no party; it stands aloof
from the clashing of opinions. If the eyes of
the young people sparkled and their faces
flushed, and daring conceptions of future life
and happiness sprang up in their minds, so
also the eyes of the old sceptic sparkled with
animation.</p>

<p>At first old Stavruchènko sat with bowed
head, listening in silence; but little by little he
grew animated, and gently touching Maxim
whispered, “How finely he plays! Wonderfully,
it must be confessed! By Jove!—”</p>

<p>As the sounds swelled a thought came into his
mind, probably of his youth; for his eyes
sparkled, his face flushed, he straightened himself,
and raising his arm seemed about to dash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
his clenched hand upon the table, but restraining
himself, allowed it to fall silently. Casting
one rapid glance at his boys, he stroked his
mustache, and leaning toward Maxim, whispered:
“They talk of putting us old people
into the archives. Nonsense! There was a
time when you and I—And even now—Is
it not true?”</p>

<p>Anna Michàilovna looked inquiringly at
Evelyn. The girl had folded her work on her
knees, and sat watching the blind musician
but her blue eyes expressed nothing beyond a
rapt attention. She was interpreting those
sounds in her own way; she fancied she could
hear in them the pattering sound of the water
in the old locks, and the whisper of the wild
cherry-tree in the dusky avenue.</p>

<h3>IX.</h3>

<p>But the face of the blind man showed none
of the rapture that had taken possession of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
audience. It was plain that even this piece
had not given him the satisfaction he was looking
for. The last notes vibrated like the others,
intimating the same question,—a murmur of
dissatisfaction; and as the mother looked at
her son’s face she saw in it an expression which
was familiar to her. The sunny day of that
far-away spring was revived in her memory,
when her boy lay prostrated on the bank of the
river, overcome by the too vivid emotions of
the new and exciting world of spring. This
expression however rested but for a moment on
Peter’s face, then vanished.</p>

<p>Now the hum of voices filled the parlor.
Stavruchènko embraced the musician with enthusiasm.
“By Jove! my dear fellow, you play
finely! That is the kind of playing we like!”</p>

<p>The young people, still excited and agitated,
were shaking hands with him. The student
prophesied a world-wide fame for him as an
artist. “That is true,” assented the elder
brother. “You are fortunate to have become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
thoroughly familiar with the character of the
folk-songs. You are a perfect master in that
domain. But will you tell me, please, what
was the last piece you played?”</p>

<p>Peter gave the name of an Italian piece.</p>

<p>“I thought so,” replied the young man. “I
am somewhat familiar with it. You have a
remarkably original style. Many play it more
correctly than you, but no one has ever yet
played it with such effect.”</p>

<p>“Why do you think that others play it more
correctly?” asked his brother.</p>

<p>“Well—how can I convey my meaning? I
have always heard it performed just as it is
written. While this sounds like a translation
from the Italian into Little Russian.”</p>

<p>The blind man listened attentively. It was a
new thing for him to be the centre of animated
conversation, and he was proud to feel his
power. So he too might accomplish something
in life!</p>

<p>As he sat there, with his hand resting on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
music-rack, listening to all this talk, suddenly a
warm touch fell on his hand. It was Evelyn,
who had drawn near, and who now with a fugitive
pressure of his fingers whispered joyously:
“You hear? You too will have work in the
world. If you could only see the effect you
produce on others by your playing!”</p>

<p>The blind man started and drew himself
erect. No one but the mother noticed this
little interlude. Her face flushed as deeply as
if she had just received the first kiss of a new-born
and passionate love.</p>

<p>The blind man still remained on the same
spot, and his face had not yet lost its pallor.
Overwhelmed as he was by the impressions of
his new happiness, he may also have felt the
approach of the storm that like a dark and
shapeless cloud was rising out of the depths of
his brain.</p>

</div>

<p>On the following day the
blind man awoke early. All was quiet in his
room, neither was there as yet any movement
in the house. Through the window which had
remained open into the garden during the night
came the freshness of the early morning. His
memory had not yet recalled to him the events
of the previous day, but his whole being was
filled with a new and unusual sensation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>Peter lay for several moments in bed, listening
to the twitter of a bird in the garden and
to the feelings stirring within his own heart.
“What has happened to me?” he thought;
and at this very moment the words which were
spoken to him in the twilight, near the old
mill, flashed into his mind: “Is it possible that
you had never thought of this? How dull
you are.”</p>

<p>It was true, Peter had never thought of it.
Evelyn’s presence had always been a joy to
him, but until yesterday he had never realized
the fact, any more than one realizes the air he
breathes. Those simple words had fallen into
his soul like a pebble upon the glassy surface of
a stream: one moment it was placid, serenely
reflecting the sunlight and the blue sky,—a
toss of the pebble, and it is shaken to its very
depths. Now he awoke like one newly born,
and Evelyn—his old companion—appeared
to him in an altered light. As he recalled one
by one the incidents of yesterday, even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
most minute, he heard with fresh surprise the
accents of her altered voice as reproduced by
his imagination,—“How stupid you are!”
“Don’t, my darling!”</p>

<p>Instantly Peter rose, dressed himself, and ran
through the dewy garden to the old mill. The
water was murmuring and the wild-cherry bushes
whispering the same as ever,—only then it had
been dark, and now it was a bright sunny morning.
Never before had light produced so palpable
an effect upon him. The bright rays of
the cheerful sun seemed to mingle with the
dewy fragrance and the universal freshness of
the early morning, stirring his nerves to a gentle
excitement.</p>

<p>But together with this pleasing agitation there
arose in the inmost depths of the blind man’s
heart another and a different feeling, so vague
and shapeless that at first he did not even
realize its presence; but gradually it grew
to be a part of himself, like the strain of melancholy
that sometimes weaves itself imperceptibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
through a merry song. It rose from the
depths of his soul as from small beginnings a
heavy cloud gathers in the heated atmosphere;
and just as a cloud is expanded by rain, so was
this emotion deepened by rising tears, until it
grew to predominate over every other feeling.
It was but recently that her words had sounded
in his ears, and he could remember every
detail of that first explanation; he seemed still
to feel her silken hair and to hear the throbbing
of her heart against his own. And out of all
this he wrought an image that made his own
heart beat with joy. Yet now a dark and
shapeless “something” rises to blight this
image with its poisonous breath, and to cause
it to vanish into empty air.</p>

<p>In vain did Peter go afterward to the mill
and spend hours at a time there, beset by contending
feelings, endeavoring to recall to his
imagination Evelyn’s words, her voice, and her
movements. He had lost the power that once
he possessed of uniting them in one harmonious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
whole. From the very beginning there had been
an intangible “something” that he had been
unable to grasp; and now this “something”
was rising above his head, as a storm-cloud
rises from the horizon. The sound of her voice
was hushed, all the impressions of that happy
evening had grown dim, and behold a void was
in their place, to fill which void there rose from
the depths of the blind man’s soul a yearning
desire. He longed to see her. The sudden
shock that had roused that evenly balanced
youthful nature from its brief slumber had likewise
awakened the fatal element that contained
within itself the germs of irrepressible suffering.
He loved her, and longed to see her.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Their guests had once more left them, and
life returned to its usual regularity at the Popèlski
manor; but the temper of the blind man
had undergone a decided change. It had become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
variable and easily agitated. When at
times his happy moments rose vividly before
him, he grew more cheerful, and his face brightened.
But this did not last long; and in the
course of time even these cheerful moments
were dimmed by the fear that they were about
to vanish, never to return. Thus his temper
grew very uneven; outbursts of demonstrative
affection and of extreme nervous excitement
were often succeeded by days of secret gloom
and melancholy. And at last the mother’s
worst fears were realized,—the fevered dreams
of childhood returned to the youth.</p>

<p>One morning Anna Michàilovna went into
her son’s room. He was still sleeping, but with
a strange and restless sort of slumber. His
eyes were partly open, and seemed to peer from
beneath his eyelids; his face was pale, and
wore an expression of alarm.</p>

<p>The mother paused as she cast a scrutinizing
glance at her son, trying to discover the cause
of this mysterious terror, which seemed momently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
to increase. But as she watched, the
strained expression on the sleeper’s face grew
more intense. Suddenly she became aware of an
almost imperceptible movement above the bed.
A sunbeam was shining on the wall over the
head of the sleeper, and as it glided downward
its vibrations grew more and more rapid. This
brilliant ray of light was stealing its way to the
half-open eyes, and the nearer it came the
greater grew the restlessness of the sleeper.
Anna Michàilovna remained motionless, as if gazing
at a nightmare; she could not turn her eyes
from the golden beam, which was drawing
slowly but perceptibly nearer and nearer to her
son’s pale face, which had become almost rigid
under the prolonged strain. The yellow light
had now begun to play over the hair and forehead
of the youth. Instinctively the mother
leaned forward to shield him, but her feet refused
to move, as if she too were under some
mesmeric influence. Meanwhile the sleeper
raised his eyelids, and the sunbeam sparkled on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
his motionless eye-balls. His head, outlined
against the pillow, was turned toward the light;
something between a smile and a sob quivered
on his lips, and again his face lapsed into its
former rigidity.</p>

<p>At last, by a supreme effort of will, the
mother overcame the torpor that had crept
over her, and going up to the bed, placed
her hand on her son’s head. He started and
awoke.</p>

<p>“Is that you, mamma?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is I.”</p>

<p>He rose on his elbow. It was as if his
consciousness were still obscured by a sort of
haze. The next moment he said: “I was
dreaming again. I often dream now, but I
can remember nothing.”</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>More than a year passed thus; periods of
gloom alternating in the young man’s nature
with a nervous irritability; and at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
time his senses, especially that of hearing, grew
more and more acute. That his entire organism
was susceptible to the light was evident
even by night; he always knew when the moon
was shining, and would often remain out of
doors, sitting motionless and sad, when all the
others in the house were sleeping,—giving himself
up to the influence of that dreamy and fantastic
light, his pale face meanwhile turned ever
in the direction of the luminous globe that was
traversing the dark-blue sky, and his eyes reflecting
the lustre of its cold rays. But when
the globe, growing larger and larger as it drew
near the earth, became veiled by a heavy red
mist and finally disappeared below the horizon
line, the face of the blind man would soften
and grow calm, and he would rise and go to
his room.</p>

<p>As to his thoughts during these long nights,
it would not be easy to describe them. Every
one who has experienced the joys and sorrows
of self-consciousness is familiar with the crisis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
that occurs at a certain period of life, when a
man, still pausing on the threshold strives to
define to himself the place he occupies in Nature,
his object in life, and his relations to the
surrounding world. This is, so to speak, a
“dead point;” and fortunate is the man whom
the impetus of life’s power carries through it
unharmed. In Peter’s case this crisis was seriously
complicated. To the question, “What is
the object of one’s life?” he added another:
“What is the object of a blind man’s life?”
Finally, into this travail of sad thoughts entered
another element,—an almost physical pressure
of unsatisfied desire, which re-acted on his disposition;
he grew more and more nervous and
irritable, without an apparent cause.</p>

<p>“I long to see,” he said when this mood had
so far relaxed that he could speak of it with
Evelyn,—“I long to see, and I cannot overcome
this desire. Could I but once, even
in a dream, see heaven and earth and the
bright sunlight, and remember it all,—could I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
but thus see my father and mother, you and
Uncle Maxim,—I should be satisfied, and
never be distressed again.”</p>

<p>And he persistently clung to that idea. When
alone he would take up different objects, feel of
them with unusual attention, and then putting
them aside try to recall their familiar outlines.
In the same way he studied the difference between
bright-colored surfaces, which the abnormally
keen perceptions of his nervous system
enabled him to distinguish quite readily by the
touch. But all this simply conveyed to Peter’s
mind information in regard to his own relations
to things, without giving him a clearly defined
idea of their intrinsic properties. He could
distinguish the difference between day and night
from the fact that the sunbeams, in some mysterious way,
penetrated his brain, irritating still
more keenly his agonizing queries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>Peter had lost all interest in the books that
Maxim used to read aloud to him, and nothing
ever arrested his attention now, unless it bore
directly or indirectly upon his own affairs.
Once he interrupted the reading to ask,—</p>

<p>“<em>Red ringing; carmine ringing</em>,—what does
that mean? Can one see colors in tones?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Maxim; “but some sounds
make an impression analogous to that of colors.
I am not sure that I shall be doing right, or
even if I shall succeed in explaining this analogy
to you so that you will be able to understand it;
but I have often thought of it myself, and this is
the way it appears to me: Whenever I look upon
a bright red surface of any considerable
dimensions, it produces on me the impression
of something flexible and quivering. It seems
as if this red surface were changing every instant;
rising from a substratum of a deeper
color, it throbs, so to speak, with swift pulsations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
of a lighter shade, making a most vivid impression
on the eyes. That may be the reason
why a certain kind of ringing is called red.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes! wait a moment,” said Peter,
quickly opening the piano; and with practised
hand he struck the key-board in imitation of
the holiday bell-ringing. The illusion was unusually
perfect. A chord in the middle register
served as a background, while the clearer
high notes rose over it as though leaping and
bounding through the air.</p>

<p>“Is that it?” asked the blind man.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is like it; and I know persons
who are as unpleasantly affected by those sounds
as I myself am affected by the color. I believe
the expression ‘carmine ringing’ refers to post-bells.
After a bell has been ringing for a long
time it grows monotonous,—the sound becomes
deeper, softer, and more uniform, although
it is still as distinct as ever. The same
effect may be obtained by a skilful selection of
the different tones.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now, listen,” said Peter; and under his
fingers the piano rang out like the spasmodic
peals of a post-bell.</p>

<p>“No, that is not the way,” said Maxim.
“You must play more softly.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, I remember!”</p>

<p>And now the instrument sent forth tones,
low, rhythmical, and sad, like the music of a
“set of bells” under the <i lang="ru">dugà</i> of a Russian
<i lang="ru">tròika</i>, receding along the dusty road in the
dim vista of evening,—a sound low and monotonous,
growing softer and softer, until the
last notes are lost amid the silence of the
quiet fields.</p>

<p>“Ah, now you have it! You have caught
the idea,” said Maxim. “Our language possesses
certain definitions applicable to our conceptions
of sound and light, as well as of touch.
Thus we use the word ‘brilliant’ in regard to
tones, and also in regard to colors; and the
word ‘soft’ belonging primarily to the sense of
touch, may also be applied to colors. We even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
say a ‘warm’ color, a ‘cold’ color. Of course
this is only by way of analogy, but they show
some points of resemblance. Some time ago,
while you were still a child, your mother tried
to explain colors to you by means of sounds.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I remember. Why did you forbid us
to continue? Perhaps I might have succeeded
in understanding.”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Maxim, “that would have
been impossible, and all your labor would have
been in vain. You can study an object by itself,
as far as its form and the space it occupies
are concerned,—and you seem able, in some
inscrutable way, to perceive vague differences
in color; but in order to gain any distinct ideas
of form, size, and color the sense of sight is
absolutely indispensable. The sooner you give
up your vain efforts the better it will be for
you.”</p>

<p>Peter made no reply; but afterward he returned
to those musical experiments that had
been given up in days gone by. While he by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the sense of touch would examine bits of bright-colored
cloth, his mother—her nerves strained
to their utmost tension, and trembling with
agitation—would try to represent the color
by a correspondence in sound.</p>

<p>Maxim no longer opposed these performances;
he realized that his influence was of no
avail against that inward impulse, and felt that
it would be better to allow the blind man to
pursue his own course, that in the end he might
be convinced that all his efforts to combine
these separate impressions were utterly in vain.
And that this result might be the sooner attained,
Maxim lent his own assistance to promote
the blind man’s researches.</p>

<p>“Uncle Maxim,” said Peter to him one day,
“you once described red to me by means of
words so vividly, I wish you would tell me about
the other colors that you see in Nature.”</p>

<p>Maxim paused to consider. “That is a very
difficult matter; but I will try. I will begin by
describing to you something with which you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
perfectly familiar, and that is blood. Blood
courses through the veins, but it cannot be
seen. It circulates through the body, diffused
by the heart, which is constantly throbbing,
beating, and burning with sorrow or joy. When
a sudden thought occurs to you, or when from
dreams you awake trembling and weeping, it
is because the heart has given a more rapid
impulse to the blood, and sent it coursing in
bright streams to the brain. Well, this blood
is red.”</p>

<p>“Red, warm,” said the young man, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Maxim paused: was it well for him to go on
with these fruitless illustrations? But when he
saw the eagerness with which the blind man
was hanging on his words, he sighed, and made
up his mind to continue.</p>

<p>“First, I will tell you about the heavens. If
you lift your arm above your head, you will
describe with it a semi-circle in space. In the
same way, infinitely far above us, we behold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
the vaulted semi-circle of the hemisphere. It
is blue. We call it the sky. The sun crosses
it from east to west,—that you already know.
You can also tell when the sky is overcast; at
such times its blue depths are hidden by the
confused and portentous outlines of dense
masses of clouds. You always perceive the
approach of a threatening storm-cloud—”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am conscious of an influence that
agitates the soul.”</p>

<p>“You are right. A blue sky is the symbol
of serene and lasting happiness. We watch for
the return of the dark-blue sky. The tempest
will pass over, while the sky above remains ever
the same; knowing this, we can wait patiently
for the passage of the storm. The sky then is
blue; and the sea when it is calm is of the
same color. Your mother has blue eyes, and
Evelyn’s eyes are also blue.”</p>

<p>“Like the sky,” murmured the blind man,
tenderly.</p>

<p>“Blue eyes are said to be the token of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
a pure soul. Now I will tell you about the
earth. A little while ago it was spring; now
the summer has come, and the surface of the
ground is nearly all covered with green grass.
The earth is black; and in the early spring the
trunks and branches of the trees look black too,
and moist; but no sooner are these dark surfaces
warmed by the rays of the sun than they
send forth green grass and leaves. Vegetation
requires light and warmth; but the amount
must not be excessive. The reason why all
that is green is so grateful to the eye, is
that it seems like the union of warmth and
cool moisture; it arouses sensations of calm
contentment and health, but not those of passion,
or what the world calls happiness. Do
you understand?”</p>

<p>“No, it is not quite clear. But please go
on.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know that I can make that
clearer; but I will tell you more. The summer
grows hotter and brighter as it goes on. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
vegetation seems to be oppressed with its own
vitality; the leaves droop, and if the heat of
the sun is not cooled by the refreshing rain, the
green vegetation grows utterly parched and
withers away. But with the approach of
autumn, the juicy fruit begins to ripen among
the brown and faded leaves, reddening most
on the side next the sun, as if all the intensity
and passion of vegetable nature were concentrated
therein. You see that even here red is
as ever the symbol of passion. It is the color
of luxury and delight; the color of sin, anger,
and madness; the emblem of unforgiving vengeance.—But
you fail to follow me!”</p>

<p>“Never mind; go on, go on!”</p>

<p>“The autumn comes. The fruit has grown
heavy; it drops and falls to the ground,—it
dies; but the seed still lives,—and therein lies
the germ of a ‘possibility’ of some future
plant, with its luxuriant foliage and its fruit.
The seed falls on the ground; and above this
ground the cold sun hangs low, the cold wind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
sweeps over it, the cold clouds float overhead.
So life and the passions die slowly, imperceptibly.
Day by day the blackness of the soil
shows more and more plainly through the green
grass, until at last the day comes when the
snowflakes fall by millions and cover the ground,
humble and sorrowful in its widowhood, with a
mantle of one uniform color,—cold, and white.
The cold snow, the clouds that float in the
inaccessible heights above our heads, the grand
and sterile mountain-peaks, all are white. It
is the emblem of a passionless nature, of the
cold purity of holiness, and of the future
spiritual life. As to black—”</p>

<p>“I know,” interrupted the blind man, “<em>that</em>
signifies silence and quiescence. It is night.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and therefore the emblem of death.”</p>

<p>Peter shuddered, and said in a low tone:
“Yes,—as you say yourself,—of death. And
for me black is the prevailing color!”</p>

<p>“You are wrong to say that,” rejoined
Maxim unhesitatingly, “when you have access<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
to all the pleasures of sound, warmth and
movement.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the young man, thoughtfully,
“that is true. Sounds also have their colors;
and I have learned to know the red tones, the
green and the majestic white ones, that soar
aloft in inaccessible heights. But those nearest
akin to me are the dark tones of grief,
which reverberate close to the earth. I never
rejoice when I play,—I weep.”</p>

<p>“Let me tell you,” said Maxim earnestly,
“of one gift which you fail to appreciate at its
proper value,—one that has been bestowed
upon you with a generosity rarely found among
mortals. We have already spoken of light,
warmth, and sound. But you know still another
joy,—you are surrounded by love. You take
little heed of this, and the reason of your suffering
may be ascribed to an egotistic cherishing
of your own woes.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” exclaimed Peter, passionately, “I
cherish them against my will! Where can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
I hide from them, when they are with me
wherever I go?”</p>

<p>“Could you once realize that the world is
full of sorrow a hundredfold harder to bear
than yours,—sorrows in comparison with which
your life, rich in consolations and sympathy,
may well be called bliss,—then—”</p>

<p>“No, no! it is not so!” interrupted the
blind man, angrily, in his former tone of passionate
excitement. “I would change places
with the lowest beggar; gladly would I wear
his rags! He sees!”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Maxim, coldly, “I will
prove to you that you are mistaken.”</p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>In a small town, sixty versts from the estate
of the Popèlski, stands a miraculous Roman
Catholic image. Persons versed in such matters
could detail accurate accounts of its miraculous
power, and all who make a pilgrimage to visit it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
on its holiday receive “twenty days absolution.”
Therefore every year, on a certain day in the
fall, the little town is so crowded that it can
hardly be recognized. On the occasion of the
anniversary, the old chapel is decorated with
flowers and foliage; the merry pealing of the
bells rings through the air, the carriages of the
Pans roll past; the town is filled with worshippers,
bivouacking in the streets and squares
and even in the neighboring fields. Nor are
Catholics the only visitors. The reputation of
the N—— image has spread far and wide, and
the sick and afflicted Orthodox, particularly
those from the cities, come also to visit it.</p>

<p>On this particular holiday of which we would
now speak, the road on both sides of the
chapel was lined with a many-colored procession
of human beings. One viewing this spectacle
from the summit of any of the low hills encircling
the place might have imagined that
some gigantic serpent had stretched itself out
over the road near the chapel, and lay there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
motionless, save when from time to time it
lifted its many-colored scales. On both sides
of the road, lined with two far-reaching rows of
men and women, stood a whole regiment of
beggars in a line, stretching their hands for
alms.</p>

<p>Maxim on his crutches, and Peter beside
him leaning on Joachim’s arm, moved slowly
along the street. Having passed the noisiest
and most crowded spot, they came to the road
where it entered the field. The hum of the
many-voiced crowd, the cries of the Jewish
tradesmen, the noise of the carriages,—all that
vast rumbling as of mighty waves, mingled into
one continuous surging volume of sound, they
had left behind them. But even here where
the crowd had diminished, they could still hear
the tramp of the foot-passengers and the hum
of the wheels and human voices. A carriage-train
of teamsters was coming from the direction
of the fields, and creaking heavily, turned
into the nearest cross street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>Peter listened absent-mindedly to this noisy
life, wondering why Maxim had brought him
there on such a day. Although Pan Popèlski
was a Catholic himself, the child had been
baptized in the mother’s church by an Orthodox
priest, and this was no holiday of his. Nevertheless
he obediently followed Maxim, once in
a while pulling his overcoat together, for it was
chilly weather; and thus he walked along, his
mind a prey to melancholy thoughts. Suddenly
in the midst of his absorption, Peter’s attention
was so violently arrested that he shuddered as
he paused. The last houses of the city buildings
ended here, and the wide thoroughfare
now lay between fences and empty lots. Just
where it entered the fields, some pious hands
had erected a stone post, with an icon and a
lantern; the latter, which was never lighted,
now hung creaking in the wind. At the very
foot of the post crouched a group of blind
beggars, who had been crowded from the desirable
places by their more fortunate competitors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
They sat there holding wooden cups,
and some of them from time to time set up a
heart-rending wail:—</p>

<p>“Give to the blind!—for Christ’s sake!”</p>

<p>It was a cold day, and since early morning
these beggars had been exposed to the cold
wind that blew in gusts from the field. The
crowd was so great that they could not keep
themselves warm by exercise, and as by turns
they drawled their mournful lamentation, the
plaintive note of physical suffering and of utter
helplessness could plainly be discerned. The
first words were quite distinct, but they were
soon lost in a mournful wail, expiring in a shudder
as of one perishing from the cold. And
yet the last low notes of the song, almost lost
in the midst of the noisy street, on reaching
the human ear struck it with a sense of the
hopelessness of the enormous suffering they
expressed.</p>

<p>“What is that?” exclaimed Peter, seizing
his uncle suddenly by the arm. His face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
changed, as though this moan were the embodied
image of some ghost that suddenly rose
before him.</p>

<p>“That?” repeated Maxim, indifferently.
“They are only blind beggars,—blind like yourself,
and somewhat cold besides. They would
like to go home, but they are hungry. You
have some money in your pocket, have you
not? Throw them a five-copeck piece.”</p>

<p>Peter, who in his anguish had rushed ahead,
suddenly stopped. He took out his purse, and
instinctively turning away that he might not
hear the mournful strains repeated, held it out
to Maxim, saying,—</p>

<p>“Give them this! Give them all you have
with you,—only let us go away! For mercy’s
sake, let us go home as quickly as possible! I
cannot, I cannot bear to hear it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>On the following day Peter was lying in his
room prostrated with a nervous fever. He lay
tossing on his bed, with a look of agony on his
face, as if he heard some sound from which he
was struggling to escape. The old local doctor
attributed this illness to a cold, but Maxim well
knew its real cause. It was a severe attack,
and at the time of the crisis the sick man lay
motionless for several days; but youth came
off victorious in the end.</p>

<p>One pleasant autumn morning a bright sunbeam
crept in at the window and rested near
the invalid’s head. Anna Michàilovna turning
to Evelyn said, “Please draw the shade. I
dread that light.”</p>

<p>Rising in obedience to her request, the girl
was arrested by the unexpected sound of the
blind man’s voice:—</p>

<p>“Never mind, please. Let it be as it is.”</p>

<p>Both women leaned over him with rapture:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you know me?” asked the mother.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the invalid; then paused, as
though trying to recall some memory of the
past. “Ah, yes!” he said softly. “How
dreadful it was!”</p>

<p>Evelyn laid her hand on his lips. “Don’t,
don’t! You must not talk; it is bad for you.”</p>

<p>Pressing the hand to his lips Peter covered it
with kisses. Tears stood in his eyes. He
wept long and freely, and seemed to gain relief.
“I shall never forget your lesson,” he said,
turning his face toward Maxim, who entered
at that moment. “I thank you. You have
helped me to realize my own happiness, by
making me acquainted with the woes of
others. God grant that I may never forget the
lesson!”</p>

<p>The disease once conquered, the youthful
constitution made short work of recovery. In
two weeks Peter was again on his feet. A
great change had taken place in him. The
serious shock to his nerves was succeeded by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
pensive but calm and gentle sadness; his very
features were changed, having lost all trace of
the old mental suffering.</p>

<p>Maxim feared lest this might prove but a
phase, occasioned by the depression of the nervous
system. But months went by, and still
the blind man’s mood showed no sign of
change.</p>

<p>The realization of one’s own misfortunes
sometimes paralyzes the energy, and plunges
the soul into a state of passive endurance;
while the knowledge of the sorrows of others
will, on the contrary, often rouse one to energetic
action, and uplifting the whole nature
stimulate mental activity, and lead one to seek
opportunities for showing sympathy.</p>

<p>A longing to relieve human misery had now
risen in Peter’s heart, supplanting his former
vain endeavor to escape from personal grief.
He had as yet no clear idea as to the ways and
means, and had but slender confidence in his
own power; yet he was inspired by hope.</p>

<p>When Evelyn announced to
the old Yaskùlskis her firm intention of marrying
the blind man, the old mother wept; but
the father, after saying a prayer to the images,
declared that it was manifestly the will of God.
In due course of time, therefore, the wedding
was celebrated.</p>

<p>Now began a new and happy life for Peter;
and yet it made no great change in him. In
his happiest moments there was a shade of sadness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
in his smile, as if he felt the insecurity of
his happiness. When he was told that he was
about to become a father, he received the news
with alarm. Still his present life, absorbed as
it was in anxiety for his wife and future child,
left him no time for brooding over the inevitable.
Now and then, in the midst of these
cares the memory of that pitiful wail of the
blind men would rise in his mind and wring his
heart with pity and compassion, thereby diverting
his thoughts into a different channel.</p>

<p>The blind man had also lost to a certain
extent his extreme sensitiveness to the outward
impressions made by light, and his mental
activity was proportionately diminished. The
turbulent organic force within him lay for the
moment dormant, with no conscious effort of
will on his part to rouse it into action, or to
combine his manifold sensations into one consistent
whole. But who can tell?—this interior
calmness may have served to promote the work
that was unconsciously to himself going on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
within him; it may have facilitated the union
of those vague sensations of light with his
logical thoughts on the subject, and the analogies
between light and sound. We know that
in dreams the mind often creates images and
ideas which it would be totally unable to produce
by the agency of the will.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>In the very same room where Peter was
born, no sound could be heard save the wailing
cry of an infant. A few days had passed since
its birth, and Evelyn was rapidly recovering.
But Peter still seemed depressed, as though
weighed down by the presentiment of some
impending misfortune.</p>

<p>The doctor taking the child in his arms
carried him to the window. Quickly drawing
aside the curtain and admitting a bright sunbeam
into the room, he took his instruments
and bent at once over the boy. Peter was also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
in the room, apathetic and depressed, with his
head drooping low. He seemed to attach no
importance whatever to the investigations of the
doctor; his bearing was that of one who feels
quite sure of the result.</p>

<p>“The child must be blind,” he kept repeating.
“Better for it, too, had it never been
born.”</p>

<p>The young doctor made no reply, but continued
his observations in silence. At last
he laid aside the ophthalmoscope, and his
calm, encouraging voice echoed through
the room: “The pupil contracts; the child
sees!”</p>

<p>Peter started, and rose instantly to his feet.
But although the act gave proof that he heard
the doctor’s words, the expression of his face
showed no comprehension of their significance.
Resting his trembling hands upon the window-seat,
and with his pale face and set features
uplifted, he looked like one petrified. Until
the present moment he had been in a state of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
unusual excitement, apparently unconscious of
himself, and yet every nerve quivering with
expectation. The darkness that surrounded
him was an actual object, which he realized in
all its immensity as something apart from himself,
enveloping him as it were, while he strove
to gain by an effort of imagination some adequate
idea of its relation to himself. He threw
himself before it as if he would shield his child
from that illimitable tossing sea of impenetrable
darkness.</p>

<p>Such had been Peter’s state of mind while
the doctor was silently carrying on his preparations.
He had wavered between hope and fear;
but now the latter, rising to its highest pitch,
had won entire control of his excited nerves,
while hope withdrew to the innermost recesses
of his heart. Then came the words, “The
child sees!” and his feelings underwent a
sudden transformation; his fears vanished, and
assurance took the place of hope, illuminating
the inner world of imagination in which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
blind man dwelt. Like a stroke of lightning it
burst upon the darkness of his soul, effecting a
complete revolution. Now he knew the meaning
of the words, “sound possessing the attribute
of light.” The doctor’s words were like a
pillar of fire in his brain; it was as if an electric
spark had suddenly kindled in the secret recesses
of his soul. Everything vibrated within
him, and he himself quivered, as a tightly strung
chord quivers under a sudden touch.</p>

<p>Directly upon this flash, strange shapes rose
before those eyes blind from birth. Were these
rays of light, or sounds? He could not tell.
They seemed like vivified sounds, that had
taken the form and the motion of light. They
were radiant as the firmament, and their course
was as that of the sun in the heavens above;
waving to and fro, they whispered and rustled
like the green steppe, and swayed like the
branches of the pensive beech-trees. And all
the time these branches were mysteriously but
clearly outlined against the sky; the steppe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
stretched far, far away; the bright blue surface
of the river rippled musically.</p>

<p>Some one touched the blind man’s hand.
Yes! he knows, he hears, he feels, he sees this
touch! Here again come the ray-sounds, shaping
themselves into visible images. From his
childhood he has known that bright vision, so
dear to his heart, reproduced in his soul with
such marvellous fidelity! He hears his mother’s
gentle voice; her tender blue eyes rest lovingly
and sadly upon his face, and somewhere
in the depths of his heart the reflection of her
gaze faintly glimmers. The silvery white hair,
the clear, pure ringing tones of her voice,—he
not only hears, he also sees and feels that fondly
loved, that pure and gentle being, the embodiment
of holy love!</p>

<p>A young, anxious, and sympathetic cry!—His
heart beats with passionate excitement.
Can it be that he has never seen her before,—his
friend, his wife, his best-beloved? Behold,
she now lies before him, distinct and wonderful!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
Pain, love, and alarm may be seen upon her
face—Eyes blue like his mother’s; and in
her voice the scarlet tones of love, vivid and
intense, unlike that of a mother,—those tones
that kindled in his heart the bright flame of
passion! She has light “fair” hair,—he
knew of course it must be so; he felt it and
now he sees it. He is conscious with every
instinct of his being that she half rises from her
bed, her eyes dilating to greet his rapture.</p>

<p>And this?—A discord; the tapping of a
crutch; a stifled exclamation! He reaches
out his hands toward the tutor who has devoted
his life to him. He knows the keen glance,
the dogged persistency, the energetic voice, the
heavy and ungainly figure that seems to belong
to the harsh, abrupt tones,—a succession of
discordant sounds against a background of controlled
emotions!</p>

<p>But now again comes the darkness, sweeping
once more in waves across the blind man’s
brain; and this form loses all distinctness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
outline, and the other images waver and mingle
one with the other, and all that is left glides
down the gigantic radius into utter darkness!
Thus intermingling, wavering, trembling, like
the vibrations of a slender wire, first high and
loud, then soft and low, these image-sounds
were hushed at last.</p>

<p>Silence and darkness, with certain vague
object-sounds, fantastic of outline, yet still
striving to rise to the surface! Peter could not
grasp their tones, forms, or colors, but somewhere
from the depths he could still hear the
resonant modulations of the scale, and seemed to
see the rows of ivory keys flashing in the darkness,
as they glided down into space. Suddenly
the sounds began to reach him in their ordinary
way. It was as if he had just waked, and bright
and joyous began to press the hands of Maxim
and of his mother.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked his mother, in alarm.</p>

<p>“Nothing! I thought I—saw you all. I
am not sleeping, am I?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>“And now?” she asked anxiously. “Do
you remember? Shall you remember?”</p>

<p>The blind man breathed a deep sigh.
“Nothing,” he replied with an effort. “I shall
transmit it all—I have already transmitted
it to the child.”</p>

<p>The blind man tottered, and fell fainting to
the floor. His face was pale, but a gleam of
joy and satisfaction still rested upon it.</p>

<p>A large number of persons
had assembled in Kiev during the period of
the Contracts to hear the musical improviser.
He was blind; but marvellous reports had
been circulated in regard to his musical talent.
Therefore the Contract hall was crowded; and
a lame old gentleman, a relative of the artist,
had taken charge of the proceeds,—all which
were to be devoted to some charitable object,
unknown to the public.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>Complete silence reigned in the hall when a
young man, with a pale face and beautiful large
eyes, appeared on the platform. No one would
have suspected his blindness, save for the rigid
expression of his eyes, and the fact that he was
led by a fair-haired young woman, who was
said to be his wife.</p>

<p>“No wonder he produces such a striking
impression,” remarked a young man to his
neighbor; “he has an unusually dramatic
countenance.”</p>

<p>Indeed, the blind man’s pale face, with that
thoughtful set look in the eyes, no less than his
entire person, impressed the beholder as something
quite remarkable; and his playing confirmed
that impression.</p>

<p>A southern Russian audience generally loves
and appreciates its national airs; and in this
instance even the mixed audience that assembled
at the Contracts was at once carried away
by the burning torrent of melody which they
heard. The marvellous improvisation evoked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
by the fingers of the blind musician revealed
his keen appreciation of the Nature so familiar
to them all, as well as a rare intimacy with the
secret springs of national melody. Rich in
coloring, graceful and melodious, it gushed forth
like a rippling stream,—rising, now into a song
of triumph, then again lapsing into a plaintive
and sympathetic murmur. At times it was as if
a storm were thundering in the sky, echoing
through space; and the next moment the
music changed to the whistling of the wind
through the grass over the mounds of the wild
steppes, reviving vague dreams of the past.</p>

<p>When the player ceased, the deafening applause
of the delighted audience filled the great
hall. The blind man sat with drooping head,
listening in surprise to those unfamiliar sounds.
But when he raised his hands and again struck
the keys, silence fell at once upon the vast
hall.</p>

<p>At this moment Maxim entered. He gazed
attentively at this crowd, which controlled by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
one emotion sat with burning, eager eyes riveted
upon the blind man. As the old man listened,
he dreaded lest this powerful improvisation,
now flowing so freely from the musician’s soul,
might suddenly end, as it used of old, in a
distressing and unsatisfied question,—thus
opening a fresh wound in the heart of his blind
pupil. But the sounds increased in volume and
power, growing more and more imperious, as
they touched the hearts of the sympathetic and
expectant audience. And the longer Maxim
listened, the stronger grew his assurance that
he recognized something familiar in the blind
man’s playing. Yes, it was that noisy street.
A clear, resonant, and buoyant wave rolls dashing
along, sparkling and breaking up into a
thousand sounds. Now it rises and swells, now
it recedes with a faint, remote, but continuous
murmur,—always calm, picturesquely impassive,
cold and indifferent.</p>

<p>Suddenly Maxim’s heart sank within him.
Again came the well-known wail from the pressure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
of the musician’s fingers. It escaped,
echoed through space, and was lost in the air.
But it was no longer the moan of individual
sorrow, the utterance of a blind man’s egotistical
suffering. Tears sprang into the old man’s
eyes, and tears stood also in those of his
neighbors, while above the picturesque, impassioned
tumult of the street rose the intensely
woful heart-rending note of lamentation.
Maxim recognized in it the pathetic
song of the blind,—“Give to the blind!—for
Christ’s sake!” It fell like a stroke of
lightning on the heads of the assembled multitude,
and every heart throbbed in unison with
the expiring wail.</p>

<p>For some time after the music ceased, the
audience, seized with horror at the awful realities
of life, sat silent and motionless.</p>

<p>The old veteran bowed his head. “Yes, he
sees at last. A perception of the woes of the
world has taken the place of his former blind,
unquenchable, selfish suffering. He feels, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
sees; and his hands are endowed with a mighty
power.”</p>

<p>The old soldier bent his head lower and
lower. His task was accomplished; his life
had not been in vain. Those full powerful
tones, as they echoed through the hall, taking
possession of the audience, bore witness to
this truth.</p>

<p class="tb">This was the <i lang="fr">début</i> of the blind musician.</p>

distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
